1.1 Information Systems  
Information systems - consist of computer hardware and software, and communication networks to collect, store, process and communicate information. An information system is more than a computerised application. Information Technology (IT) is widespread in modern information systems, and IT can support all levels of management. Information systems provide the information required to assist management in the following areas: 
. Planning: setting the organisation's long-term strategic direction and planning for the medium and short term. 
. Control of the organisation: management needs to monitor how the organisation is performing against the plan and take actions to correct any significant deviations from the plan. 
· Decision-making: managers need to make decisions at many different levels. The information systems should provide them with the information to do this. 

1.1.1 Strategic Planning This is the highest level of management in an organisation, and it is usually carried out by the board of directors or an equivalent body. This management level concerns with setting goals and objectives for the organisation over the long term (typically 5-15 years). Strategic planning may include the following: 
· Deciding which products or markets to be in. · Investment decisions. 
· Planning for environmental changes. 
· Identifying the competitive advantage of the organisation. 

1.1.2 Tactical Management Tactical management, or management control, usually is carried out by a middle level of management. It involves taking the strategic plan and making it happen. The time for planning usually is one year. Tactical management includes the following tasks: 
· Ensuring that resources are obtained and used effectively and efficiently in accomplishing the objectives of the organisation; 
· Implementing strategic decisions, often by way of a long-term plan; · Preparing annual budgets, and comparing actual results with budgets monthly; and 
· Recruiting staff. 

1.1.3 Operational Management Operational management focuses on the day-to-day running of the business, and operational managers will be responsible for departments within an organisation. Operational managers are involved in the following: 
· Routine planning such as staff rotas (rosters; schedules). 
· Programmed decisions based on internal, transaction-based information (e.g. ordering inventory when inventory levels fall to the reorder levels). These are usually actions undertaken when certain criteria or rules are met-for example, ordering inventory when inventory levels fall to the reorder level.

Quiz: Planning and Control 
Vacation Lodge runs a chain of three-star hotels throughout the world. The company's head office is in New York, where the executive and non-executive directors are based. Each hotel has a management team headed by a general manager. The other management team members are the financial controller, the rooms division manager, the food and beverage manager, the sales and marketing manager, and the head of security. Each hotel has a restaurant manager, who manages the restaurant staff including the kitchen chefs. 

Required: Describe the types of plans prepared by the directors, the management teams and the restaurant manager. For each plan, describe control measures that can be used to see how well the plan is being achieved. 

The following is not an exhaustive list of the plans and controls - any other reasonable plans and controls are also relevant. 
|                    | Plans                                       | Controls                                                    |
| Board of directors | Five-year financial plan New hotel openings | Actual profits vs. plan monitoring progress                 |
| Management team    | Annual budget Staff head count              | Compare actual against budget Occupancy rates Actual v plan |
| Restaurant manager | Menus Staff rotas                           | Food wasted Staff attendance                                |

1.1.4 Costs 
Costs of information systems include: 
· Pre-implementation/development costs analysing current business processes and how they will be automated in a new system. 
· Initial set-up costs - hardware, software licensing (e.g. based on the number of users) and installation costs. 
· Data conversion of historical information (e.g. from paper documents and spreadsheets). 
· Staff and user training and IT support. 
· Modifications and system upgrades. 
· Communication charges (e.g. for internet access). 

1.1.5 Benefits 
The main benefit of an information system is the ability to provide users with the information they need to do their work efficiently. Other benefits will depend on the specifics of the information provided. For example: 
· Strategic information provides strategic management with an overview of the entire business. 
· The ability to extract customised information saves time and clerical expense. Many business decisions can be delegated to a lower level of the business. 
· A system is more efficient because data is easier to use. The same data may be presented in customised formats (e.g. lists, tables, graphs and charts) for different users (see s.4). 
· Information provided in real-time can drive improvements (e.g. in meeting customers needs). 


1.2 Information Technology 
1.2.1 Internet The term Internet describes the global network of computers and devices connected with an Internet Protocol (IP) address. It is a valuable source of information for businesses, for example: 
· Competitors' websites. 
· Online newspapers with access to back copies. 
· Online databases containing names and contact details of potential customers. 

1.2.2 Intranet Intranet refers to a subset of the internet that is an organisation's private network that only authorised users can access. It allows the sharing of information, typically to employees throughout the organisation. However, controls should exist to ensure that employees only have access to information that is relevant to their function. It would be inappropriate, for example, if all employees had access to the human resources files. Intranets facilitate collaboration and document sharing, which provides for remote working. For example, many institutions, such as universities, have a portal accessible only to registered lecturers and other employees. 

1.2.3 Wireless Technology Wireless technology is a communications technology used to transmit and receive data between two devices without a physical connection. Communication technologies use radio frequency, infrared, satellite, etc. It is used increasingly for data transmission. 
· Wi-Fi allows tablets, laptops, printers and smartphones to communicate with the Internet. 
· Mobile phone (cell) networks allow electronic devices to communicate over long distances. 
· Bluetooth exchanges data over short distances (e.g. between fitness trackers and smartphones). 
· Radio Frequency ID (RFID) tags digitally store data that radio waves can read. It has many applications in industry, such as inventory management, asset tracking and controlling access to restricted areas. 

1.2.4 Network Technology A computing network is a group of two or more devices that communicate by physical or wireless connections. Networking technologies connect multiple computers and devices and share information. For example: 
· Local Area Network (LAN) - a group of computers connected across short distances (e.g. using a router). 
· Wide Area Network (WAN) - for example, the Internet, connects computers worldwide. 
· Storage-Area Network (SAN) - a dedicated high-speed and high-performance network that connects shared pools of storage devices to several servers. 
· Virtual Private Network (VPN) - users access a private network across the internet to send and receive data as if their devices were connected to the private network. 


1.3 Principal Controls 
1.3.1 Purpose of Controls Controls and procedures over the distribution and generation of internal information need to be in place to ensure that: 
· Reports are only prepared when the benefits of the report exceed the cost of producing it. 
· Reports should only be sent to relevant managers. There is a danger of "information overload" if certain managers are copied on every report, they will not read any of them. 
· Information is not duplicated. 
· Only relevant information is included in the report. 

1.3.2 Types of Control The principal controls over the distribution and generation of internal information are: 
· The format of the reports to be generated should be agreed upon in advance. 
· Distribution lists should be provided for all reports. 


1.4.1 Security 
Information security - protects the interests of those relying on information (and the information systems and communications that deliver the information) from harm resulting from hacking, operational error, sabotage and other threats. 
Security - protection of the system from harm. 
Privacy - restriction of knowledge to authorised persons. 
Security and privacy are very closely related, and it is often difficult to determine whether a particular risk relates to security or privacy. What is clear, however, is that security relates to the whole system whereas privacy refers only to the data held within the system. 

1.4.2 General Security Controls Training all staff in computer security procedures is essential in creating: 
· An appropriate attitude of mind (e.g. integrity, carefulness, security-aware); and 
· Strong security culture within the organisation. 
Staffing arrangements should include the following: 
· Authorisation for access and change routines to programs. 
· Segregation of duties For example, programmers in charge of developing features on corporate systems should not have access to make changes to the code of "live" programs, nor be able to view sensitive real-time data and processes without authorisation. Any changes to live programmes should be vetted and authorised by personnel of appropriate authority before being released. 
· Thorough vetting of job applicants before being employed. 
· Application of appropriate procedures for cleansing of security access for staff that have been terminated, such as the disabling of access to accounts, company data, and premises and removal from any authorisation workflows. 
· Risk analysis on sensitive staff (e.g. to identify low morale, poor motivation, and potential "grudge" bearers). 

1.4.3 Physical Access Controls Physical access controls that prevent unauthorised people from accessing computer systems include: 
· Security guards and cameras; 
· Time controls (e.g. only allowed access between certain times); 
· Electronic door locks (PIN, card or bio-data entry). 

1.4.4 Logical Access Controls Once someone has gained physical access to a computer system, the next level of security would be logical access controls. The logical access system aims to protect data or software from the potential threats of unauthorised access. Controls may include: 
· System passwords (see s.1.4.5); and 
· Usage logs (usually computer generated). 
Call-back security (dial-back security) is used to authenticate users who access systems remotely. For example, a user logging into a system over a telephone line enters a user name and password, and the system calls the user back on a pre-agreed phone number. 

1.4.5 Passwords 
Password - a sequence of characters known only to the user; its input allows access to a computer system (or part thereof). Password characters should be alpha, numeric, upper and lower case, and, preferably, the password should be non-sensible (i.e. not an everyday word) but not too difficult so as to make it impossible to remember (hence the conundrum). In some very secure systems, passwords must have a special character (*, &, #, @, etc.). 
· Passwords should be changed regularly and not connected with the user (e.g. birthday, address) or written down (e.g. on a post-it note). 
· Passwords for access to different functions should not be the same (e.g. a password for general admission to the system should not be the same for admission to the payroll). 
· Each access level of a password-protected program should be protected with a different password. 
· Attributes for each password should be established (e.g. read-only, read and write, valid for x number of entries, valid until a given date or event, etc.). 
· Minimum format requirements for each password should be specified (e.g. a minimum number of characters and include at least one upper case letter/number/symbol). 
· Passwords should never be divulged or readable from the screen as entered (i.e. an asterisk or dot should be visible rather than the actual character typed). 
· The company policy on passwords should be documented and made available to all staff members. 
· The number of password attempts should be limited for high-risk systems. For example, only three attempts are allowed at ATMs, after which the cash card is retained by the system and not returned. 

1.4.6 Hacking 
Hacking - deliberate unauthorised access to a system and the data within that system. 
Hacking originally described unauthorised activity by individuals who saw systems security as a challenge and wished to show they could breach the security in place. The term now describes stealing (also includes reading) or changing data, or any other aspect of a system (e.g. changing programs, adding additional routines). Most people consider hacking an external threat (e.g. via the Internet). However, the majority of hacking is carried out internally by employees. Hacking usually takes one of two forms: 1. Authorisation attack - password cracking using computer programs that work through dictionaries and other sources to generate passwords for repeated sending to the system until the correct password is found. 2. Trapdoor/backdoor attacks - utilising existing weaknesses within the program code of the system. Sometimes, these are deliberately programmed into the system by the programmer, who, for example, can bypass the password system later. 
Measures to combat hacking include: 
· Physical security; 
· Logical security; 
· System logs and audit trails; 
· Sentinels ("watchdog" programs which check for unusual activity); 
· Data encryption (s.1.4.7); 
· Strong quality control and risk analysis procedures in developing programs and websites. 

1.4.7 Encryption The principle of encryption is to make any intelligible data unintelligible, which can then be read-only using the decryption key. It prevents unauthorised access to, or understanding of, for example, the data being transmitted or stored. 
· It involves an algorithm (the operation itself) and a key (a secret numerical code usually consisting of many letters, numbers and symbols). 
· To be read, the message must be unscrambled (decrypted) using a matching key. 
· Helps protect critical information (e.g. credit card details) and addresses the problems of authentication and integrity (once the credit card details have been unscrambled by the receiver, however, they may be subject to hacking). 

1.4.8 Software Audit Trail
Audit trail - a record of important data about each transaction. A software audit trail could include, for example, user and terminal identifications, the time and date of the transaction, transaction type (e.g. despatch), quantities and values, and cross-references to related transactions (e.g. invoice). The software audit trail records information about online transactions so the transaction and its path (both backward and forward) can be inspected and verified by third parties (e.g. internal auditors and system analysts). 

1.4.9 Testing Systems Security It is of no use to have security systems in place unless they work and are known to operate effectively. Using in-house staff to test the system may be one option, but they may have a vested interest in it. Many external organisations (e.g. large accountancy practices and consultancies) offer "attack and penetration" services to their clients. They attempt to access the computer system: 
· Physically, for example, attempted access to the surroundings of the computer system and into the computer room. 
· Logically, by attempting to penetrate the system directly through dial-up connections, tapping external data lines and gaining access codes and other information (often simply by asking). 


2.1.1 Internal The principal internal sources of management information from within the organisation are: 
· Accounting system - provides information on costs and revenues, and can provide sophisticated outputs such as product cost using activity-based costing. 
· Inventory system - contains information about movements in and out of inventory and quantities held. 
· Payroll system - contains information about employee costs by department. 
· Purchase processing system - contains information about suppliers (invoices, addresses, key personnel, costs and invoices received). 
· Sales processing system - often contains detailed information about all customers' purchases and preferences. In retail businesses, many customers use loyalty cards, so whenever they buy from the company, the sales system records information about who is buying what. 
· Qualitative information systems (e.g. customer satisfaction) - aggregate customer surveys or other qualitative data. 
Although these systems have a primary purpose, their information could be interrogated and used to provide other useful management information. For example, information in the sales processing system could be used to analyse sales by customer or product for marketing purposes. 

2.1.2 External 
External information is likely to be used for strategic purposes. As indicated previously, this includes information about competitors, markets, and the economy. 
Primary information is tailored information that is provided to meet an organisation's needs, such as: 
· market research into new products; or 
· obtaining information about prices charged by competitors. 
Secondary information is data produced for general use rather than specific to an organisation's needs. Examples include: 
· Government statistics; 
· Country reports produced by consulting firms; 
· Business directories of detailed information about the activities of other organisations; 
· Trade magazines or other similar publications may provide useful information about external factors affecting a business. 

2.2 Use of Information in Control The different levels of management have several uses for management information for control purposes: · Strategic managers are more involved in long-term planning and control of the organisation. Control concerns high-level information (e.g. actual profits for a period by division, market share, etc.). 
· Strategic managers compare this information with the long-term plan and take action if the objective is not achieved. 
· Tactical managers are interested in running the organisation efficiently. Therefore, they will be interested in more detailed, usually internal, information. Comparison of actual costs and revenues against budget will be important information for control. Monitoring quality also will be necessary. 
· Operational managers would be interested in detailed transactional information from all the sub-systems (e.g. the inventory system). 


3.1 Accounting Information Requirements 
3.1.1 Strategic Planning and Control Information Information for strategic planning typically: 
· Addresses objectives at a high level, not detailed (e.g. a summarised statement of profit or loss for the entire organisation). 
· Includes much external information. 
· Addresses ad hoc information needed one time only for special projects rather than regularly. 
· Will contain forecasts covering a longer time horizon. 
Examples of information for strategic planning include the following: 
· Economic and market forecasts; 
· Analysis of competitors. 
Examples of strategic control information are: 
· Profits by business segment; 
· External factors influencing the organisation; 
· Present and potential market studies; 
· Investment appraisal. 

3.1.2 Tactical Planning and Control Information Information to support tactical planning, on the other hand, will: 
· Contain more detailed information (e.g. detailed statements of profit or loss analysing revenue and costs by division or product). 
· Be mainly internal, although some external information may be used. 
· Be provided regularly (e.g. monthly analysis of revenues compared with budgets and variance analysis). 
· Contain forecasts over periods up to 12 months. The most obvious example of information used for tactical planning is the annual budget. 
Examples of tactical control measures include: 
· Analysis of sales by product/customer/geographical location. 
· Inventory levels. 
· Cash flow projections. 

3.1.3 Operational Planning and Control Information Operational planning typically requires transaction-based data. This is almost entirely internal, covering short-term periods. Examples of operational control measures include: 
· Variances (e.g. materials and labour); 
· Receivables/payable levels; 
· Payroll details; 
· Customer complaints; 
· Output records. 

3.2 Information Systems 
The four main types of information systems that support the different levels of an organisation may be summarised as follows: 
STRATEGIC: EIS Executive Information System 
TACTICAL: DSS Decision Support System, MIS Management Information System 
OPERATIONAL: TPS Transaction Processing System 

3.2.1 Transaction Processing System (TPS) 
Transaction Processing System - systems used by operational staff to capture data and make processes more efficient, improving the accuracy and timeliness of information. 
Transaction Processing System (TPS) data is primarily high-frequency and short-term. Transaction processing is automated, with limited human input. A TPS collects and stores data about transactions and may include controls. A transaction takes place when goods or services are exchanged for some form of payment. For example: 
· Purchasing an airline ticket from an airline's website. 
· Buying groceries from a supermarket. The transaction is recorded when the cashier records the sale in the cash register, typically using a barcode reader. Payment is also taken at this point. 
· Withdrawing cash from a bank ATM. 
· Receiving inventory in the warehouse of a factory. 
Transaction processing systems use one of two approaches to process the data: 1. Batch processing - individual transactions of the same type are collected (into "batches") and stored for later (periodic) input to the computer. Processing proceeds in discrete "runs". Payroll transactions are often processed using batch processing: - information about new joiners, leavers, hours worked, etc is collected during a particular period; - payroll calculations are made at the end of the period (e.g. a week or a month). Batch processing is easier to control as data can be checked and validated before processing. 2. Real-time systems processing - transactions are processed immediately as they occur. This has the apparent advantage that information in the system is always up-to-date. The disadvantage is that it can be challenging to control, and the risk of errors is greater. 

A TPS will include controls to ensure that the information entered into the system is valid and that the processes are accurate. This is important; otherwise, the information generated by the system will not be reliable. 
Example: EPOS 
The TPS in a supermarket may include an electronic point of sale (EPOS) system, where the goods are scanned by the cashier using a bar-code reader when the customer is checking out. It may also use an electronic data interchange (EDI) system that enables the supermarket's system to communicate with the suppliers' systems. The following transactions cycle occurs: 1. Customer proceeds to checkout, and the cashier scans the bar code on the products to calculate the amount payable. 2. The inventory database is updated to reflect the sale of goods. 3. Customer presents credit or debit card - this is scanned, and the payment is transferred from the customer account to the supermarket's bank account. Alternatively, the customer pays in cash, and the system records a cash receipt. 4. At the end of the work shift, the cashier counts the cash in the cash register and compares this to the system's record of how much cash there should be. 5. Re-order level is reached for an item of inventory. 6. EDI is used to automatically place an order with suppliers. 7. When an order is ready, the supplier informs the retailer that goods have been sent (also through EDI). 8. Bar codes on goods can be used to track them during delivery. 9. When received, bar codes are read, and the retailer's systems are updated (e.g. inventory control, purchases and payables). Suppliers may also be informed that the goods have been received (through EDI). 10. Supplier sends purchase invoice to the retailer (through EDI). 11. Invoice details checked by the retailer's system and agreed to information already on the database. 12. Payment authorised and then made by EDI authorising the retailer's bank to allow a transfer of funds to the supplier's bank. 13. Retailer's database updated to record payment and settlement of the liability. 

3.2.2 Management Information System (MIS) 
Management information system - systems that convert data from internal and external sources into information used by management at all levels and across all functions to make timely and effective decisions. 
An MIS is, therefore, any system for: 
· obtaining data; 
· processing it to produce useful information; and 
· distributing this to the relevant managers or members of staff. 
Information from an information system is used for three purposes: 1. Planning - deciding what the organisation (or that part of the organisation under the control of a particular manager) will do. 2. Controlling - ensuring that the organisation stays on course to meet its plan. 3. Decision-making - deciding between different courses of action (e.g. whether or not to develop a new product).
-------
Quiz: Suggest examples of information that would be required from an information system for each of the following: 
a. A market trader working in a fruit market; and 
b. Materials purchasing department in a factory. 
Answer:
Market Trader
The market trader will need to have some forecasts of demand for each type of fruit on a particular day. This will probably be based on experience and "gut feeling" rather than on any formal information. The trader will also need to know what prices customers are willing to pay and what prices competitors are charging. How much cash has been taken each day. This will be ascertained by counting it. The information systems used by a market trader are informal, based on observation.
Materials Purchasing Department
The materials purchasing department will need to know the following information:
· Existing quantities of all materials in the warehouse.
· Expected use during the forthcoming period. This will be based on production schedules and bills of materials for each product that is made.
· Information about economic order quantities to ensure that purchasing decisions minimise the costs of holding and ordering inventory.
------

Information systems come in many different shapes and sizes. For example: . In a small, owner-managed organisation, the MIS will be informal; the owner will obtain most of the information that he needs: - from discussions with the staff; and - by observing what is happening. · In larger organisations, specially designed information systems will be needed. The growth of IT has led to organisations taking a more formal approach to developing the information systems they need. Especially in larger organisations, care should be taken to plan the needs of an information system before it is developed to avoid the risk of the following problems: 
· Poor communication of information to appropriate personnel. 
· Bad decisions are being made because of inaccurate data. 
· Information is provided late. 

3.2.3 Decision Support System (DSS)
Decision Support System - a computer-based information system that supports managers in decision- making, often utilising analytical modelling techniques. Decision support systems assist in complex decision-making. DSS analyse large amounts of data and provide information about the likely outcome of decisions based on rules and assumptions programmed into the system. Variables can be changed to reflect the conditions that might affect the decision. A simple example of a decision support system is a financial model in a spreadsheet, which calculates a potential investment's net present value. Users can change variables in the model and perform what-if analysis to help decide whether to invest. 

Example: Decision Support System 
Larga is an original equipment manufacturer that employs many employees across multiple shifts. These employees have contracts varying from full-time to part-time that have committed to being available at specific hours on certain days of the week. Larga uses a decision support system (DSS) to create its weekly duty roster. The DSS extracts the necessary information from the HR system, such as available employees and their hours, employee leave, and specific functions of the employees (for example, an employee is specialised in a particular area of manufacturing) and solves a duty roster that ensures optimum staffing for each production line throughout the week. Suppose the DSS is unable to suggest staffing for any specific section of the production line; in that case, it flags the shortage as an error so that the production and human resource managers have time to arrange alternate staffing arrangements or adjust production line loading. 

Decision support systems do not have to be complex. For example, a forecasting model on a spreadsheet, whereby variables such as economic growth can be changed, would also be described as a decision support system. 

3.2.4 Executive Information System (EIS) 
Executive information system - a system designed to assist the decision-making of senior management by providing summarised information from internal and external sources relevant to the organisation's strategic goals. It is a specific type of decision support system. An EIS typically provides senior management with high-level information about the company's performance. This information may be extracted from a central database, using reporting tools. The systems may also be linked to external data sources (e.g. financial information from Internet sites). Charts, tables and other graphical tools often accompany numerical data in a "dashboard" that helps managers visualise performance, with "drill down" facilities to provide more detail. An EIS often allows users to customise their view to focus on information most relevant to them. This overcomes the problem experienced in many information systems whereby senior managers receive standard monthly reports irrelevant to their concerns. 

3.2.5 Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP)
Enterprise resource planning system - a software system which provides a seamless flow of information across an entire organisation using a shared database. Before ERP systems, different departments (e.g. warehouse and finance) would have separate systems. These systems were not linked, so traditional communication methods were used for inter-departmental information sharing. The same information was often entered into two or more systems, so time-consuming reconciliations had to be carried out. An ERP system is designed to integrate the main functional areas of business processes into a unified "enterprise-wide" approach and to serve the whole organisation. 

The "modules" which may be found in an ERP system typically include the following: 
· Accounting and financial; 
· Inventory control; 
· Supply chain management; 
· Material requirement planning; 
· Customer relationship management (see s.3.2.6). 

Implications of the introduction of an ERP system for the management accountant include: 
· A reduction in gathering and processing routine information. In a supermarket, for example, sales are recorded when barcodes are scanned at the checkouts. 
· A change in the work of the management accountant, who can now spend more time as a business advisor because the system automates many routine tasks he once performed. 

3.2.6 Customer Relationship Management System (CRM) 
Customer relationship management system (CRM) - a CRM system used to manage customer interactions and data, to improve customer service, retain customers and drive sales growth. At a basic level, CRM software consolidates customer information and documents (e.g. purchasing history, demographics and returns) for easy access and management. CRM captures, analyses and distributes all relevant data from customer and prospective customer interactions to everyone in the organisation. This distribution of information helps an organisation better meet customer, product and service needs. For example, data can be used to create target customer profiles to find opportunities to upsell and reward them for their loyalty. Characteristics of a sound CRM system include: 
· Easy import of data from existing databases. 
· Ease of use (e.g. an intuitive interface and good user support). 
· Adaptability (as the business should grow). 
· Improved customer satisfaction. 
· Easy reporting and tracking features. 

3.3.1 Characteristics 
Big data - vast data sets that may be analysed to reveal patterns, trends and associations, especially relating to human behaviour and interactions. 
Structured data - data stored within defined fields within a defined record, along with similar data, according to the specifications laid down in a data model. The data model limits the data collected and how it can be processed. 
Unstructured data - information gathered in various forms and ways, not in accordance with any data model, and thus may be difficult to store or analyse. 
The following have been adopted as essential characteristics of big data: 
Volume: a tremendous amount; more than can be easily handled by a single computer; for example, retailers have details of all customer purchases and enquiries. 
Variety: non-uniform, from internal and external sources, some structured, but primarily unstructured; examples would include customer demand, complaints, reviews on websites, and tweets about the business. 
Velocity: fast and continuous; it has to be processed quickly to yield useful results. 
Veracity: is the data valid, and can its accuracy be relied upon? Assessment of veracity involves considering the reliability of the data itself and the source providing the data. Machine-generated data may be more reliable than data from human sources, which may be easy to manipulate. In addition, veracity links to velocity in that if data is changing rapidly, there is a risk of using out-of-date data. 
Value: Big data analysis could be costly in terms of facilities needed and staff time spent. Data specialists may have to be employed. The organisation must, therefore, consider the value that the analysis of big data could create. 

3.3.2 Data Analytics 
The processing of big data is generally known as data analytics and includes the following: 
Data testing: testing models or hypotheses on existing data. 
Data mining: analysing data to identify patterns, relationships and correlations. Note that data mining refers to the analysis process, not the finding of the items themselves. There are a number of aspects of data mining: 
· Finding relationships between variables; 
· Applying known structures to new data; 
· Identifying groups and structures within the data that have similarities other than those connected by known structures ( clustering ); 
· Spotting unusual items (outliers) or items that appear to be in error; 
· Finding a function that expresses the relationship between the data with as little error as possible (covered in Chapter 10); 
· Providing the results in a user-friendly, easy-to-see, form. 
Predictive analytics: a type of data mining that often uses statistical or machine learning techniques to predict future events (e.g. the likelihood that a customer may be persuaded to buy a more expensive product). 
Text analytics: scanning emails and word documents to extract useful information (e.g. keywords that indicate an interest in a product). Similarly, voice analytics (but with audio). 
Statistical analytics: used to identify trends, correlations and changes in behaviour. 

3.3.3 The Big Data (DIKW) Pyramid The big data pyramid originated in the work of Ackoff and was developed further by Jennifer Rowley. It is designed to show the stages of the transformation of the initial unstructured data obtained into material that can be used for reliable decision-making and accurate forecasting. Wisdom Knowledge Information Data Guidelines to produce tables: 
· Has a suitable title; Each column has a heading; 
· Each row has a heading; 
· Totals are shown in bold. 

| Level       | Description                                                                                                                                                                          | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
| Data        | Facts and figures. Data may be provided from several sources, ideally in a format that enables links to be made between different items.                                             | For an airline undertaking "overbooking" (airlines sell more tickets than seats on the plane to ensure planes are used at maximum capacity). Data might include: . Ticket prices and purchase date relative to flight date. . passenger check-in or "no-show", and impact on plan capacity utilization . Season and/or time of year . Overbooking compensation offered . Passenger demographics . Compensation acceptance rates . Forced overbooking removal rates
| Information | Identifying data relationships. The initial analysis aims to find the meaning of the data and establish what links and relationships there are between the data. If these are established, the data becomes information.| The following relationships might exist: · Passengers who purchased tickets earlier accept lower compensation. . Passenger no-show rates are higher at certain times of the year. . Compensation acceptance rates and amounts correlated to the ticket price.                                                                                                                                                                                                      
| Knowledge   | Understanding data relationships. Further analysis provides more detail about the context of how and why the links between the data might arise and what the specific connections and patterns are. Establishing these things means that the data becomes knowledge. | The following understanding could be ascertained: . 90% probability of accepting compensation is at 80% of ticket price. · Compensation rejection rates higher and no-show lower during major holiday seasons. . Persons travelling alone have higher compensation acceptance rates.                                                                                                                                                                              z
| Wisdom      | Improved decision-making from the understanding of data relationships. Ensuring the knowledge can be used to make an informed decision and correct predictions means that it becomes wisdom. | Design of ticketing and overbooking policy and processes, with adjustments to compensation amounts, alternative flight dates, and compensation offers made based on prevailing conditions at the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

3.3.4 Benefits Analytical findings can provide information to enhance decision-making and performance management. For example: 
· Marketing - gaining insights about customer preferences through browsing histories of pages visited and purchases made; "Customers who viewed this item also bought 
· Customer service - through the collation of feedback from various sources (including social media). 
· Competitive strength - through using the information to identify and respond to changes in customer preferences earlier than competitors. 
· Customer loyalty - data gathered through loyalty cards to make personalised offers to customers (e.g. discount vouchers). 
· Operational efficiency - for example, better forecasting of sales volumes will improve inventory management and reduce wastage (e.g. of perishable goods). 
· Performance measurement - through the ability to access a variety of insights into how the organisation is doing, avoiding over-focus on information that is most readily available. 

3.3.5 Challenges and risks Despite the examples of the use of big data in commerce, particularly for marketing and Customer Relationship Management (CRM), there are some potential dangers and drawbacks. 
· Cost: It is expensive to establish the hardware and analytical software needed, though these costs are continually falling. 
· Time and staff resources: Analysing which data is essential for the organisation and its impact may be time-consuming. 
· Regulation: Some countries and cultures worry about the amount of information being collected and have passed laws governing its collection, storage and use. Breaking the law can have serious reputational and punitive consequences. 
· Loss and theft of data: Apart from the consequences arising from regulatory breaches, as mentioned above, companies might find themselves open to civil legal action if data were stolen and individuals suffered as a consequence. 
· Incorrect data (veracity): If data held is incorrect or out of date, erroneous conclusions are likely. 
· Overfitting: the risk of finding patterns in the data which are not there or which cannot be used on other data or used to predict the future. 

3.3.6 Uses The uses of big data and data analytics can be illustrated by some of the biggest companies in their industry. Netflix began as a DVD mailing service and developed algorithms to help it predict viewers' preferences and habits. Now, it delivers films over the internet and can easily collect information about when movies are watched, how often films might be stopped and restarted, where they might be abandoned and how users rate films. This allows Netflix to predict which films will be popular with which customers and produce its TV series with much greater assurance that they will succeed. Amazon is the world's leading e-retailer. It collects vast amounts of information about customers' preferences and habits to use in personalised marketing. For example, to make recommendations to customers based on previous purchases. British Airways, an airline, knows where, when and how often each customer has flown, in which class and their preferred seating. Its "create a trip" booking system knows how often customers search for a flight before booking, how susceptible they are to price reductions, and whether they are returning with them but did not fly out with them. It also knows whether car hire was purchased and what hotels are booked. As a result, it can plan for routes that are growing in popularity and seasonal destinations. Knowing the profitability of each customer means that, for example, if a flight is cancelled, the most valuable customers can be given priority. Target is the second largest discount retailer in the USA. A headline in the article "How Target Figured Out A Teen Girl Was Pregnant Before Her Father Did" caused a media storm in 2012. With the aid of a statistician the company identified 25 products that, when purchased together, indicate that, a woman is likely to be pregnant. This helped Target offer discount coupons on baby-related products to expectant mothers. 

4.1 Importance of Data Visualisation 
Data visualisation is the display of information graphically, using various forms such as charts, graphs, and maps. Data visualisation aims to present data to users in a form that is easy to understand and analyse, summarising big data in a way that even non-technical users may understand. It should facilitate the identification of trends, patterns, outliers, anomalies, and comparisons between items on various bases and allow for further insights, such as changes of perspective from general to specific or from past to future (forecasts). What matters is that the visualisation tells the user what they need to know compellingly, with an attractive form fulfilling the function of communicating what the data is supposed to say. There are many different visualisations, and they are used according to what is most appropriate to display the data and inform users. Once the data has been "cleaned" (i.e. errors, mistakes and irrelevant data removed) and arranged meaningfully, it can be presented and communicated to the person(s) who will be using it in a way that they will find easy to understand. 

4.2 Tables Tables should always be set up so they fit on one page. This makes them much more user-friendly so that all of the information can be seen at the same time. If data or information used to prepare a table has been taken from a specific source, this should be noted somewhere on the table. Guidelines to produce tables: 
· Has a suitable title; 
· Each column has a heading; 
· Each row has a heading; 
· Totals are shown in bold. 
Example: Tabulate of Budgeted Profits 
Cost and revenues of different sales levels at Winston's Football Factory

4.3 Charts and Graphs Charts and graphs tables are helpful ways of quickly highlighting relationships and trends within data. Type Example Description Line chart Line charts are useful for showing trends over time, such as sales revenue growth. Bar chart Bar charts help show comparisons. For example, comparing budget revenue per month against actual results. Pie chart Pie charts can show a relative comparison to a whole, such as sales in different regions. Scatter diagram A scatter diagram ("scattergraph") is used to plot pairs of numerical data, with one variable on each axis, to look for a relationship between them. If the variables are correlated, the points will fall along a line or curve (see Chapter 9). 
| Type             | Example                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Line chart      | Line Chart picture         | Line charts are useful for showing trends over time, such as sales revenue growth.                                                                                                                                                                |

Key Point The following elements are crucial for effective charts: 
Chart title - Name of the chart, describing its contents and purpose. 
Labelled axes - Define the axes of the chart. 
Legend (key) - Provides context data points displayed on the chart. 
Gridlines - Lines on the chart to assist the user in comparing data points to axes. 
You will not be required to present charts, graphs or any other diagrams in the exam. However, you need to understand their construction in order to interpret them.

4.4 Bar Charts Bar charts are drawn with two axes: the independent variable on the x-axis and the dependent variable on the y-axis. Bar charts must be drawn from the origin (where the x- and y-axes are both zero) to reduce misinterpretation. Bar charts are best used for comparison between two data series. For observing a trend, a line chart may be superior. Data presented in a bar chart can take many forms. 
4.4.1 Simple Bar Chart A simple bar chart is typically used to present a single data series over several periods. 
------
Quiz: Simple Bar Chart 
Present the following information as a simple bar chart: 
|      | Franklyn's Football Factory |
| Year | Sales $000                  |
| 1    | 21.00                       |
| 2    | 52.00                       |
| 3    | 24.00                       |

Answer: 
Draw a bar chart titled "Franklyn's Football Factory: Simple bar chart showing sales in Years 1-3" presents the sales data in thousands of dollars ($'000s) over three years.
- Year 1: Sales were $20,000.
- Year 2: Sales increased significantly to $50,000.
- Year 3: Sales decreased to $25,000.
The vertical axis represents sales in thousands of dollars, ranging from $0 to $60,000. The horizontal axis represents the years, labeled 1, 2, and 3. Each bar's height corresponds to the sales value for that particular year.
------

4.4.2 Compound Bar Chart 
A compound ("clustered") bar chart is used to present multiple data series over multiple periods (also called a "multiple" bar chart). 
Example: Two Data Series over Multiple Periods 
This example shows two data series: Total sales and Total costs. The legend (key) is essential in differentiating the data series. Total sales are blue and Total costs are red. 
Draw a compound bar chart titled "Total Sales and Total Costs" presents the total sales and total costs in thousands of dollars ($'000s) over five years, from 20W9 to 20X3.
- For the year 20W9:
  - Total sales were $500,000.
  - Total costs were $400,000.
- For the year 20X0:
  - Total sales were $550,000.
  - Total costs were $450,000.
- For the year 20X1:
  - Total sales were $600,000.
  - Total costs were $500,000.
- For the year 20X2:
  - Total sales were $650,000.
  - Total costs were $550,000.
- For the year 20X3:
  - Total sales were $675,000.
  - Total costs were $650,000.
The vertical axis represents the values in thousands of dollars, ranging from $0 to $700,000. The horizontal axis represents the years. The blue bars represent total sales, and the red bars represent total costs. Each pair of bars shows the comparison between total sales and total costs for each year.

Some observations are: Sales have exceeded costs every year, indicating profit (the blue bar is higher than the red bar); Both sales and costs have increased over the years; Costs have increased faster than sales (the gap between red and blue bars has narrowed over the years); Sales in 20X3 have exceeded $600,000 (blue bar exceeds $600,000 gridline); There was a significant increase in sales and costs from 20W9 to 20X0 (wide gaps between the bars of 20W9 compared to 20X0). 


Example: Compound Bar Chart 
Draw a compound bar chart titled "Sales by Division" presents the sales data in thousands of dollars ($'000s) across four divisions (North, South, East, and West) over five years, from 20W9 to 20X3.
For the year 20W9:
- North: $200,000
- South: $150,000
- East: $100,000
- West: $50,000
For the year 20X0:
- North: $220,000
- South: $170,000
- East: $200,000
- West: $50,000
For the year 20X1:
- North: $200,000
- South: $190,000
- East: $180,000
- West: $50,000
For the year 20X2:
- North: $210,000
- South: $180,000
- East: $190,000
- West: $60,000
For the year 20X3:
- North: $230,000
- South: $200,000
- East: $180,000
- West: $50,000
The vertical axis represents sales in thousands of dollars, ranging from $0 to $250,000. The horizontal axis represents the years from 20W9 to 20X3. Each group of four bars for each year shows the sales in the North, South, East, and West divisions. The blue bars represent the North division, the red bars represent the South division, the green bars represent the East division, and the purple bars represent the West division.

Some observations are: South has overtaken North as having the highest sales in 20X3 (the blue bar is the tallest for all years except 20X3); West has been experiencing declining sales (the purple bar getting shorter over time); Sales in the North have been consistent (not much change in the blue bar over time). 

Key Point 
Compound bar charts do not show the proportion of a data series to the total. There is also a risk of overloading the chart with data, diluting its meaning. 


4.4.3 Component Bar Chart 
A component ("stacked") bar chart presents the numerical amounts of data series that make up a total.
Component can also be converted to proportions of a total (similar to a pie chart). This loses the numerical amounts. 

4.5 Line Charts Line charts are drawn with two axes, usually with the independent variable on the x-axis and the dependent variable on the y-axis. Care must be taken during the production and interpretation of the chart if the axes of a line chart are not drawn from the origin (i.e. the point where the x and y axes intercept at x = 0 and y = 0). A line chart is best suited to observe trends over time. 
4.5.1 Simple Line Chart 
Example of Simple Line Charts: Give an example that shows a gentle increase in the sales trend over five years. By contrast, give another example  of simple line chart that shows a more significant rate of change in total sales. 

4.5.2 Multiple Line chart 
Example of Multiple Line Chart: draw a multiple line chart with two lines: one is for the Total sales, and the other for the Total costs. The Total sales is in blue color, and the Total costs in red color. The y-axis is not from the origin. The smaller scale means that the rate of change in the lines appears more significant. The gap between the lines is profit. The narrowing of the gap in 20X2 and 20X3 means that profit is shrinking. It is easy to see the sales and cost trends and how they compare. 

4.6 Pie Charts 
Pie charts are most suitable for showing the proportions of multiple data series at a single period or point. The entire "pie" is 100%, with each data series representing a proportion of it. For example, 25% would be a quarter of the pie. 

4.7 Scatter Diagram 
Scatter diagrams plot data points on a chart with two variables for each axis.

Example of Scatter Diagram

Plotting the pairs of data gives the following scatter diagram:
Draw a scatter diagram based on the above table's data.
There appears to be a relationship between output units and total costs (more output, higher cost), although some cost variations occur at some of the output levels. Where there appears to be a linear relationship between two variables, a trend can be estimated using a "line of best fit". 

4.8 Inappropriate Use of Data Visualisation

1.3 Planning, Control and Decision Making 
Key Point Planning, control, and decision-making encompass establishing objectives and evaluating policies and actions required to achieve them. 
1.3.1 Planning Planning is the setting of goals and the selection of the means of achieving these goals. As businesses become large, these procedures need to be formalised. 
· Short-term plans, such as an annual budget, detail the intended results for the forthcoming year. 
· Long-term plans, also called "strategic" plans, are usually documents showing the long-term objectives of a business. 

1.3.2 Control Control means checking that an organisation is on track to meet its long- and shortterm objectives and taking action to correct any deviations from these. 
· Long-term control includes strategic performance evaluation, which measures an organisation's performance against its strategic objectives. 
· Short-term control focuses on comparing the budgeted results with actual results. 
· This usually takes the form of an operating statement, which breaks down the difference into parts (variances). 

1.3.3 Decision Making Decision-making usually involves using the information provided by the costing system to make decisions. For example, when an organisation decides the appropriate price to charge for a contract, they are tendering for or whether it would make financial sense to outsource the production of an essential component. 


2.0 Introduction
2.1 Marginal Costing Under marginal costing: 
· Fixed overheads are not included in unit costs but are treated as a period cost (i.e. written off in full in the statement of profit or loss in the period they occur). 
· Inventory valuation includes only the variable costs of production. 

2.2 Absorption Costing Under absorption costing, fixed production overhead costs must be allocated, apportioned and absorbed. 
2.2.1 Allocation As overhead costs are incurred, they must be allocated to the cost centres to which they belong. Costs related to a single cost centre are allocated to that cost centre. 
Cost centre - a location, function or item of equipment in respect of which costs may be ascertained and related to cost units for control purposes. 
2.2.2 Apportionment Apportionment is necessary when an overhead is common to multiple cost centres. Such overheads must be shared between the relevant cost centres using an appropriate method of apportionment. 

Example: Apportionment 
| Cost                          | Basis of apportionment    |
| Rent, rates, heat             | - Floor are               |
| Supervision, canteen costs    | - Number of employees.    |
| Depreciation, plant insurance | - Carrying value of plant |

2.2.3 Re-apportionment Overheads apportioned to service cost centres must be re-apportioned to production cost centres. This is achieved by selecting an appropriate re-apportionment basis, that would reflect how service departments support production departments. Common basis used include: 
· Direct labour hours 
· Machine hours 
· Parts movements 
· Variable overheads utilised All fixed costs apportioned to service cost centres will be re-apportioned to production cost centres for absorption into cost units. 

2.2.4 Absorption The total overheads in each production department must now be absorbed into the production units. This is achieved using one of the following methods: 
· direct labour hour rate; 
· direct material cost rate; 
· direct labour cost rate; 
· prime cost percentage rate; 
· machine hour rate; or
· unit of output rate.

Quiz: Overhead Absorption 
X Co estimates that its factory costs for the coming year will be as follows: 
|                    | S       |
| Direct material    | 40,000  |
| Direct wages       | 60,000  |
| Prime cost         | 100,000 |
| Factory overhead   | 30,000  |
| Total factory cost | 130,000 |
During the year, 10,000 direct labour hours and 5,000 machine hours are available, and 20,000 units will be produced.
Required: (a) Calculate the overhead absorption rate using each of the following bases: i. direct labour hours; ii. direct materials cost; iii. direct labour cost; iv. prime cost; v. machine hours; vi. units of output. (b) Management has decided that the absorption rate per machine hour is the most appropriate method of absorbing overheads. One of the products manufactured by X Co is the Smidget. Each Smidget costs $5 per unit in materials and $10 per unit of direct labour. Making a Smidget requires half an hour of machine time. Calculate the full absorption cost of one unit of Smidget. 

Answer:
a. Overhead absorption rates 
i. Direct labour hour rate = $30,000/10,000 hrs = $3 
ii. Direct material cost rate = $30,000/$40,000 = 75% 
iii. Direct labour cost rate = = $30,000/$60,000 = 50% 
iv. Prime cost percentage rate = $30,000/$100,000 = 30%
v. Machine hour rate = $30,000/5,000 hrs = $6 
vi. Unit of output rate = $30,000/20,000 units =$1.50 

b. Full absorption cost 
|                                            | $  |
| Materials                                  | 5  |
| Direct labour                              | 10 |
| Prime cost                                 | 15 |
| Overhead absorbed (0.5 machine hours x $6) | 3  |

3.1 Introduction 
Activity-based costing (ABC) - an approach to the costing and monitoring of activities which involves tracing resource consumption and costing final outputs. Resources are assigned to activities and activities to cost objects. The latter use cost drivers to attach activity costs to outputs. - Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) Official Terminology 2005 

Traditional absorption costing uses one method of apportioning all overhead costs between products, typically labour hours or machine hours. This "blanket rate" means that product costs may not accurately reflect the true product overhead costs. When overhead costs accounted for only a small portion of total factory costs, this inaccuracy was not significant. However, in modern factories and service industries, due to the reduction in the amount of labour used and the increase in the amount of high technology, overhead costs are often a significant portion of overall product costs. The inaccuracy of absorption costing is no longer insignificant. Activity-based costing aims to identify the activities that cause overhead costs to be incurred and to apportion the overhead costs to each product based on the use of the activities by each product. ABC recognises that traditional ideas of fixed and variable cost categorisations may not be appropriate and that, as the proportion of overhead costs in manufacturing has increased, there is a need for a more accurate method of absorbing these costs into cost units. It looks for a clearer picture of cost behaviour and a better understanding of what determines the level of costs (i.e. "cost drivers"). 

3.2 Cost Drivers 
Cost driver - a factor which can cause a change in the cost of an activity. 
In absorption costing, it is assumed that the volume of output is the factor which determines costs. However, ABC recognises that the amount of cost may be determined by factors other than the output volume. These factors are called cost drivers. For example, the number of purchase orders processed could be the cost driver for a procurement department. An activity could give rise to multiple cost drivers as it consumes different types of overheads. For example, cost drivers associated with a production activity may be: 
· Machine operator(s) hours for apportionment of human resource costs; 
· Floor space occupied for apportionment of the cost of premises; 
· Power consumed as direct overheads; and 
· Quantity of waste and rejected output for apportionment of recycling and quality costs. 

Therefore, different overhead cost types are absorbed into production units using more appropriate rates based on cost drivers rather than a single absorption rate. For example, for a particular production department, the following rates may be suitable: 
· A warehousing cost/kg of material used; 
· Electricity cost/machine hour; 
· Production scheduling cost/production order, etc. 
These can then be applied and aggregated to calculate an overhead cost per unit, as in Step 5 of the following section. 

3.3 Steps 
To find total product costs, overheads are traced to individual production departments, as usual, with common costs being apportioned using suitable bases. Then, the following steps are applied: 

Step 1 Identify major activities within each department which create cost. Examples:(1) Production scheduling  (2) Machining (3) Dispatching of orders (4) Inspections
Step 2 Create a cost centre/cost pool for each activity-the "activity cost pool". Examples: Cost pool for: (1) all production scheduling costs (2) all machining costs (3) all dispatching costs (4) all inspection costs 
Step 3 Determine what causes the cost of each activity- the "cost driver". Examples: (1) Number of batch set-ups for production scheduling  (2) Machine hours for machining (3) Number of dispatch orders for dispatching (4) Number of inspections Cost per unit of driver 
Step 4 Calculate an absorption rate for each "cost driver". Examples: Cost per unit of driver: (1) batch set-up (2) machine hour (3) dispatch order (4) inspection
Step 5 Calculate the total overhead cost for manufacturing each product. e.g. Product Z (1) No. of batch set-ups for Product Z * Cost per batch set-up = x1 (2) No. of machine hours for Product Z * Cost per machine hour = x2 (3) No. of dispatch orders for Product Z * Cost per dispatch order = x3 (4) No. of inspections for Product Z * Cost per inspection = x4; y = x1 + x2 + x3+ x4.
Step 6 Calculate the overhead cost per unit. e.g. Product Z Overhead cost per unit = y / No. of Zs produced 

Identifying the cost drivers in a business enables management to better understand cost behaviour. 

Example of Activity-Based Cost 
A company assembles two product models in batches: Basic in 2,000 units and Deluxe in 100 units. Each Basic model has 20 components, and each Deluxe model has 30 components. It takes 5 hours to assemble a Basic model and 6 hours to assemble a Deluxe model. 20,000 units of the Basic model and 2,000 units of the Deluxe model are budgeted for the next period. The total fixed overhead budget of $224,000 has been analysed into three activities and cost drivers identified as follows: 
| Activities /cost pools:     | Cost driver:                |
|                             | $                           |
| 1. Batch set-ups            | 90,000 Number of set-ups    |
| 2. Stores/material handling | 92,000 Number of components |
| 3. Other (rent, etc.)       | 42,000 Labour hours         |
| Total overheads             | 224,000                     |

Number of units of cost drivers (Step 3) 
1. Number of set-ups required: 30 calculated as: 
Basic: 20,000/2,000 = 10 
Deluxe: 2,000/100 = 20 
2. Number of components required: 460,000 calculated as: 
Basic: (20,000 x 20) = 400,000 
Deluxe: (2,000 x 30) = 60,000 Total components = 460,000 
3. Number of labour hours required: 112,000 calculated as: 
Basic: (20,000 × 5) = 100,000 
Deluxe: (2,000 × 6) = 12,000 
Cost per unit of cost driver (Step 4) 
1. Batch set-ups ($90,000/30)                   $3,000 per set up
2. Stores/material handling ($92,000/460,000)   $0.20 per component
3. Other overheads ($42,000/112,000)            $0.375/labour hour 
Total overhead for each product (Step 5) 
|                             | Basic   | Deluxe | Cost     | Basic   | Deluxe |
|                             | No.     | No.    | (Step 4) |	$     |    $   |
| 1. Batch set-ups            | 10      | 20     | $3,000   | 30,000  | 60,000 |
| 2. Stores/material handling | 400,000 | 60,000 | $0.20    | 80,000  | 12,000 |
| 3. Other (rent, etc.)       | 100,000 | 12,000 | $0.375   | 37,500  | 4,500  |
| Total overheads             |         |        |          | 147,500 | 76,500 |

Overhead cost per unit of product (Step 6) 
| Number of products     | 20,000 | 2,000  |
| Overhead cost per unit | $7.375 | $38.25 |

Under traditional absorption costing, using labour hours, the overhead cost of the Deluxe model would be only 20% more than a Basic model. However, the ABC approach substantially increases the cost of making a Deluxe unit; the set-up costs for each batch are spread over far fewer units. The effort and cost incurred in producing small batches are now reflected in the higher cost per unit. Deluxe units should have a higher selling price to justify the higher costs incurred.

Quiz: Activity-Based Costing v Absorption Costing The total budgeted fixed overheads for a company are $712,000. These have traditionally been absorbed on a machine-hour basis. The company makes two products, A and B. 
|                      | A     | B      |
| Direct material cost | $20   | $60    |
| Direct labour cost   | $50   | $40    |
| Machine time         | 3 hrs | 4 hrs  |
| Annual output        | 6,000 | 40,000 |

The company is considering changing to an ABC system and has analysed the overhead cost into three activities: 
| Activities /cost pools: | $       | Cost driver:    |
| Machine related         | 178,000 | Machine hours   |
| Set-up related          | 230,000 | Set-ups         |
| Purchasing related      | 304,000 | Purchase orders |
| Total overheads         | 712,000 |                 |

| Machine hours/unit |   | Annual output | Total machine hours | Number of set- ups | Number of purchase orders |
| Product A          | 3 | 6,000         | 18,000              | 16                 | 52                        |
| Product B          | 4 | 40,000 	 | 160,000             | 30                 | 100               	|
|                    |   | 46,000        | 178,000             | 46                 | 152                       |

Required: 
a. Calculate the total cost for each product, assuming that the company continues to absorb overheads on a machine-hour basis. 
b. Calculate the cost per unit using the ABC system. 
c. Compare the cost per unit of each product using ABC with the cost per unit using absorption costing, and identify the main reasons for the difference. 

Answer:
(a) Traditional 
Total overhead =$712,000 
Total machine hours=178,000 
Rate per hour = $712,000/178,000 = $4/hour

(c) Comparison of costs under ABC and absorption costing 
There is a significant difference in the cost per unit of Product A when using ABC compared to traditional absorption costing. Under absorption costing, the cost per unit was calculated as $82; under ABC, the cost rose to $103.67, an increase of 26%. The difference in the cost per unit of Product B is less significant. It falls to $112.75 under ABC, compared to $116 under absorption costing, a drop of 3%. 
The cost of Product A is significantly understated when absorption costing is used. A significant factor in this is set-up costs. The total set-up costs apportioned to Product A were $80,000, equivalent to $13.33 per unit. Product B, by contrast, has total set-up costs of $150,000, equivalent to $3.75 per unit. Product A used 16 set-ups to produce 6,000 units, which is 375 units per set-up, and Product B used 30 set-ups to make 40,000 units, achieving an output of 1,333.33 per set-up. 
Similarly, in product-related costs, the cost per unit of Product A was $17.33 ($104,000/6,000 units), and the cost per unit of Product B was $5 per unit ($200,000/40,000). This is because, on average, one purchase order was used for 115 units of Product A (6,000/52) and one for 400 units of Product B (40,000/100). These differences in the use of the activities are disguised when absorption costing is used, and all costs are absorbed on a machine-hour basis. 

3.4 Analysis of ABC 
3.4.1 Advantages The main advantage of ABC is that the costs per unit are more accurate, as overhead costs are apportioned to products based on their use of the cost drivers rather than using some arbitrary "blanket rate" as used for absorption costing. This leads to the following benefits: 
· Better decision-making. Companies will have a more accurate knowledge of cost and profit per unit. They can evaluate whether to stop producing loss-making products. 
· Where cost-plus pricing is used, applying ABC means that the price will be more likely to achieve the desired margins. 
· There is a better understanding of what causes costs resulting from identifying the cost driver. This enables managers to make more informed decisions on actions to reduce costs. 
· Control of overheads is more straightforward, as responsibility for incoming costs must be established before ABC can be implemented. 
· More accurate performance measurement leads to better performance management. 

3.4.2 Disadvantages 
Although ABC provides a more accurate treatment of overheads, it is not without disadvantages: 
· ABC is still based on budgeted overheads in the current period, which may be unsuitable for future strategic decisions; 
· It is more complex, and the selection of cost drivers may not be straightforward: - There may be more than one possible cost driver for a particular overhead, so some judgment is required in selecting an appropriate driver. - As not all costs will be easily identified with particular cost pools, some allocations will be arbitrary. 
· Additional time and cost will be incurred to set up and administer the system. 

3.5 Comparison of ABC and Traditional Methods 
The differences between traditional methods of absorbing overheads and ABC methods can be summarised as follows: 
Traditional Absorption Costing :
· Initial allocation and apportionment of overheads is to cost centres. 
· Absorption of overheads of each cost centre is based on the volume of output (e.g. number of units or labour hours). As costs may not depend on volume, some allocations may be inappropriate. 
· Many different cost types for a particular cost centre are included in that department's blanket overhead absorption rate.
· Since costs are assumed to depend on output volume, limited information is provided to management about ways to reduce costs. 
· Absorption costing is relatively straightforward.   
Activity-Based Costing:                                                                                                                                                  
· Initial allocation and apportionment of overheads is to cost pools. Each cost pool represents a particular activity.                                                    
· Absorption of overheads of each cost pool is based on the "driver" that causes the costs to vary. Product costs reflect more accurately the activities that cause them. 
· Costs for a particular activity will include only the costs of performing that activity.                                            
· Identification of cost drivers allows management to understand better the causes of costs and to find more appropriate ways to control them.                            
· ABC requires a large project to identify activities and drivers. The accounting system may have to be amended or replaced to provide the information needed.            

3.6 Use of ABC in the Public Sector 
In many countries, governments are making greater use of management accounting techniques to: 
· allocate government funds more efficiently to areas where they provide the most benefits; 
· reduce the amount of overall government spending; 
· provide greater transparency so that taxpayers can see where their money is being spent, and 
· encourage public sector bodies to become more responsive to their customers. 
ABC is useful in helping public sector bodies assess their services' costs more accurately. However, ABC's disadvantages also apply to public sector organisations. Critics also argue that public sector resources would be better spent improving "front line" services than developing sophisticated accounting techniques such as ABC. 

Example of Hospital Operating Theatre 
A hospital needs to monitor the costs per patient; part of this is the cost of surgery. Under traditional methods, the operating theatre might be treated as a cost centre. An absorption cost per minute could be calculated by dividing the total costs of the theatre by the total number of minutes budgeted to be available. The cost of an operation would then be calculated by multiplying the number of minutes the procedure takes by this absorption rate. The problem with this approach is that it is unrealistic to assume that the cost per minute of all operations is the same. Some operations may require several surgeons and medical staff; others may require just one or two. Different equipment and different quantities of consumable materials will be used. Examples of activities that could be used for an ABC approach to calculating the cost of an operation include: 
| Activity                          | Driver                                                                                                                                |
| . Preparing the operating theatre | . Number of operations - the cost of preparing the theatre does not vary significantly between different types of operations.         |
| . Activity of anaesthetist        | . Number of operations - calculated separately for those requiring a general anaesthetic and those requiring only local anaesthetics. |
| . Anaesthetic drugs               | . Time taken from entering the anaesthetic room until entering the recovery room.                                                     |
| . Activity of the physician       | . Time taken from initial incision to closure of incision on completion of surgery.                                                   |
| · Consumable items during surgery | . Itemised list of consumables used during surgery, captured by a bar- coding device.                                                 |
| · Overhead activity               | · A charge for management administration and staff training.                                                                          |


Summary: 
· Management accounting is concerned with preparing and presenting accounting information to assist management in planning, controlling and making decisions.
· Costing involves calculating the unit cost of a product or service. Traditional methods are absorption costing and marginal costing.
· Under absorption costing, a share of fixed production overheads is included in the unit cost. The steps used in absorption costing are: Allocation and apportionment to cost centres; Re-apportionment of service centre costs to production cost centres; Absorption of the total cost of each production cost centre into the unit cost using an appropriate basis (e.g. labour or machine hours); 
· Activity-based costing (ABC) aims to provide a more meaningful product cost by linking costs to the activities that drive them.
· Steps in ABC: 1. Identify the activities that cause costs to be incurred. 2. Allocate and apportion costs between "activity cost pools". 3. Identify the cost drivers for each activity. 4. Calculate the absorption rate per unit of driver (divide costs in (2) by quantities in (3)). 5. Calculate the total overhead for the product (multiply (4) by the number of activities for each product). 6. Calculate the overhead cost per unit of product (divide (5) by the number of units for each product).
· The main advantage of ABC is that it focuses on the activities that cause costs rather than products.
· The main disadvantage is its complexity (and implementation cost), making it inappropriate for many organisations.

1.1 Traditional Management Accounting Traditional management accounting is inward-looking, focusing on controlling costs. The most important techniques are: 
· costing systems (marginal and absorption costing); 
· budgeting systems; · standard costing and variance analysis; and 
· working capital management. 

1.2 Business Environment Changes 
During the 1950s and 1960s, the Western industrialised nations enjoyed strong positions in international markets. There was little competition either on price or quality. Businesses could continue to be successful by doing what they had always done. During the 1970s, however, this stable business world began to disappear: 
· Less protection in home markets and increased globalisation led to increased competition from newly emerging industrialised nations (particularly Japan). 
· The introduction of computerised manufacturing systems led to the opportunity to reduce manufacturing costs while increasing the quality of products. 
· Products' lifecycles began to shorten, so there was increased demand for new products from consumers.
· The growth of service industries. · Business combinations resulted in larger multinational organisations with diverse operations. 
· Change in the business structure with more decentralised decision-making. 

1.3 Growth of Services Industries 
Many of the traditional management accounting practices were aimed at manufacturing businesses. However, many "post-industrial" economies have developed that include a significant proportion of service industries. Service industries can be distinguished from manufacturing by the following characteristics, which can be memorised on with the mnemonic SHIP: 
· Simultaneity (also called inseparability): The service is consumed simultaneously as it is performed, so there is usually more emphasis on getting it right the first time, as there may be no second chances. 
· Heterogeneity (also called variability): The standard of services will vary from service to service. For example, hairdressers in a salon will usually have different talents, and each haircut and styling could be unique to each client. This characteristic makes it more challenging to ensure that all services are of a consistently high standard. 
· Intangibility: Tangible products have a physical aspect; customers can point to the specific features/ physical characteristics they value. On the other hand, a service does not have physical characteristics, making it more challenging to identify what aspects of the service customers value. 
· Perishability: Services cannot be stored. Businesses, therefore, need to strike a careful balance between the need for sufficient resources to meet demand at peak times and the need for efficiency. 
· Non-transferability of ownership: Often, there is no transfer of ownership when a service is provided. For example, a hotel guest only has the right to access their room for the duration of their stay. 

1.4 Adding Value and Avoiding Waste 
The modern business environment emphasises the removal of activities that do not add value and the elimination of waste. A non-value adding activity is one that any that does not enhance a product or service for the customer. In this context, two developments are worth specific mention: 1. Total Quality Management; and 2. Just-in-Time manufacturing. 

1.4.1 Total Quality Management (TQM) 
TQM is a philosophy of "getting it right the first time". It recognises that the costs of bad quality may exceed the costs of good quality. 
Total Quality Management consists of continuous improvement in activities involving everyone in the organisation, managers and workers, in an integrated effort towards improving performance at every level.

1.4.2 JIT Manufacturing The traditional Western approach to manufacturing was to produce to maximum capacity. Production was driven by internal plans rather than external demand. This led to a variety of weaknesses: 
· Excessive holding of inventory with the associated costs of storage and obsolescence; 
· Delays between the customer ordering products and the delivery of the products; 
· Bottlenecks in the production process not being identified; 
· A lack of flexibility in meeting changes in customer requirements. 

The demand for finished products drives a just-in-time (JIT) production system, so each component on a production line is only produced when needed for the next stage. 
· A "pull through philosophy" - customer demand drives production. 
· Requires careful planning of demand and production requirements. 

JIT purchasing means that raw materials are received when needed for production, so raw material inventory is reduced to near-zero levels. 
· Smaller, more frequent deliveries are required at short notice. 
· A few dedicated suppliers deliver defect-free components just in time when the parts are demanded on the production line. 

Key Point Inventory holding costs are low, but ordering costs are high. 

1.5 Response of Management Accountants Several new management accounting techniques evolved in response to the changing business environment. The methods included in the syllabus for the Performance Management exam are: 
· Activity-based costing (see Chapter 2); 
· Target costing; 
· Life-cycle costing; 
· Throughput accounting; 
· Environmental accounting. 

2.1 Aim and Use In traditional cost-plus pricing models, the cost of a product is the starting point for calculating the price. Having determined the unit cost of a product, a profit margin is then added to calculate the price. This approach is flawed in a competitive world; the estimated price may be too high for the market to accept. In a competitive market, the price of a product may be determined by the market. Companies, therefore, have to accept the market price. Target costing is a marketing approach to costing. It attempts to achieve an acceptable margin in a situation where the price of a product is determined externally by the market. This margin is achieved by identifying ways to reduce the product's costs. 

Target costing - subtracting a desired profit margin from a competitive market price to determine the maximum acceptable cost. 
Target costing is most appropriately used during the design phase of a product (where cost savings can be identified by changing the design of the product to avoid unnecessary costs from being designed into the product); 

2.2 Steps in Target Costing 
1. Determine the price the market will accept for the product based on market research. This may take into account the market share required. 
2. Deduct a required profit margin from this price - this gives the target cost. 
3. Estimate the actual cost of the product. If it is a new product, this will be an estimate. 
4. Identify ways to narrow the gap between the actual cost of the product and the target cost. 

Summary on how the target price and profit may be determined: 
· The starting point is to define the product specification. This involves designing the product and determining, in detail, which features will be included. 
· The sales volume is defined, and the target price is set. This price will be based on the organisation's pricing strategy and market research, which will help determine the price at which the required output volume can be sold that meets profit objectives. 
· The required profit may be based on the investment required to produce the product and the needed return on investment. 
· The target profit is then divided by the number of units to obtain the required profit per unit, which is deducted from the target price to give the target cost.

Quiz: Target Costing 
Exclusive Motors is designing a new version of its luxury car, the Z123 series. The vehicle will be launched next year. It is expected to have a lifecycle of 10 years. The production of the car will require an investment of $3 billion. The company needs a profit of 20% a year on this investment. The marketing department believes that the car could be sold for a price of $40,000 each. 100,000 cars would be manufactured and sold each year. 

Required: Calculate the target cost of one Z123. 

Answer:
|                                                | $million|
| Expected revenue (100,000 × $40,000)           | 4,000   |
| Required profit (20% × $3 billion)             | 600     |
| Total target cost                              | 3,400   |
|                                                | $       |
| Target cost per car ($3,400 million / 100,000) | 34,000  |

------

2.3 Application to Service Industries 
Target costing is likely most appropriate in manufacturing industries, where a volume of standard products is to be made. Although it can also be used in service industries, there may be additional challenges: 
· In many service industries, the "products" are non-standard and customised. It is difficult to define a target cost when there is no standard product. 
· A higher portion of the expenses in service industries are indirect (overheads). It is harder to reduce these on a product-by-product basis. 
· Reducing costs in a service industry may be at the expense of customer service or quality. In manufacturing industries, it may be possible to identify cost savings that remove product parts that customers do not value. 

Example of Target Costing for Services 
Gates & Jobs Co is a tax advisory business. There is much competition for tax services in the market where Gates & Jobs is located, and one competitor has recently started to advertise that it will do tax returns for a flat rate of $100 per return. Gates & Jobs Co has decided to match this price for a basic tax return, provided the client has no capital gains tax to pay. Gates & Jobs currently aims to make a profit of 20% of all fees charged to clients. The target cost of the tax return is, therefore: 
Standard fee $100 
Less: Required margin $20 
Target cost $80 
Based on observation and discussions with the management accountant, the actual cost of a "typical" tax return is as follows:
Direct costs Time of senior adviser (1 hour at $15 per hour) $15 
Time of partner review (15 minutes at $100 per hour) $25
Total direct costs $40 
Overheads apportioned at 150% of labour time $60 
Actual cost $100
There is, therefore, a cost gap of $20. Although it can be argued that the price of the tax return of $100 does cover all direct costs, and therefore increases contribution, the partners are keen that all services should contribute to the business's overheads at a 150% rate. 

Methods which might be used to reduce the cost gap include: · Reduce the time the senior takes (e.g. using a software package). · Reduce partner time (e.g. the partner might not review basic returns). · Reduce the overheads of the business (e.g. using ABC methods to identify more accurately the drivers of overheads) and find ways to economise. 

2.4 Narrowing the Target Cost Gap 
Target costing relies on multi-disciplinary teams discussing ways to reduce the gap between the actual (expected) and target costs. There are various methods to reduce product cost; an important consideration when using these techniques is to ensure that the perceived value of the final product/service is not reduced (which would lead to lower effective selling prices). Some methods which may be used are: 
· Reconsider the design to eliminate non-value-added elements. For example, snap-together fasteners and automated glue dispensing may be used instead of screws (which require high labour manipulation) 
· Reduce the number of components or standardise components. For example, multiple separate components that need to be welded together in car assembly may be cast as a single piece, reducing welding costs and improving structural integrity. 
· Use less expensive materials. Using cheaper materials may reduce overall unit cost, but there is a significant risk of reducing perceived value. 
· Employ a lower grade of staff on production. Using a lower staff grade may reduce labour costs. However, management must closely monitor quality costs. It might be suitable if the production process does not require specialist skills. 
· Invest in new technology. This usually involves a significant upfront cost to acquire the technology, and its value may be related to how effectively the new technology is utilised. Lifecycle costing may be used to have better insight into the actual cost of the investment Outsource elements of the production or support activities. 
· Outsourcing activities is a common cost reduction action; however, care must be taken to ensure outsourced components and services are of the required quality and that crucial value drivers and capabilities are not lost in the outsourcing process. 
· Reduce manning levels or redesign the workflow. Redesigning workflows and processes (using Kaizen, for example) helps reduce production costs. Ensure dysfunctional shortcuts disguised as cost-cutting measures are not built into the redesigned workflow. For example, removing supposedly non-value-adding activities such as precision measurement and quality tests might lead to deterioration in the consistency of quality. 
The following techniques may assist such methods: 
"Tear down analysis" (also called "reverse engineering") - involves examining a competitor's product to identify possible improvements or cost reductions. 
Value engineering - involves investigating the factors that affect the cost of a product or service. The aim is to improve the design of a product so the same functions can be provided for a lower cost or save cost by eliminating those the customer does not value. 
Some writers distinguish between four elements of value: 1. Utility or use value - how useful the product is to the owner. 2. Esteem value - how the product increases the owner's well-being. 3. Scarcity value - the high value of diamonds results from their scarcity. 4. Exchange value - the amount the owner sells the product for. 

Key Point 
The value engineering technique is applied to new products/services at the beginning of the development process during the design stage (i.e. before production starts). Value analysis evaluates the value of an existing product or service. 

Functional analysis - involves identifying the attributes/ functions of a product that customers value. The price the customer is prepared to pay for each function is then determined. The function should be dropped (abandoned) if the cost of providing it exceeds the value (marginal revenue) it generates. Businesses should ensure that any steps taken to reduce product costs do not lead to a lower perceived (or actual) quality, as this may reduce the price the product could sell for. This would then reduce rather than increase the margin from selling the product. 
Increasing the sales price is not a viable method of reducing the gap. 
· The whole purpose of target costing is to achieve a reasonable margin when the market determines the competitive price. 
· Charging a higher price would lead to a significant fall in demand for the product. 

Key Point
Target costs can be driven down by directing attention to any costs related to any part of a product's lifecycle (see next). 

3.0 Introduction 
Target costing emphasises cost control through good product design and production planning, but those up- front activities also cause costs. There might also be costs incurred after a product is sold, such as warranty costs and plant decommissioning. Therefore, to profit from a product, its total revenue must exceed its total cost, whether these costs are incurred before, during or after the product is produced. This is the concept of life-cycle costing. 
Life-cycle costing - a system that tracks and accumulates the actual costs and revenues attributable to each product from development through to abandonment. 
3.1 Product Lifecycle The product lifecycle describes how demand conditions for a product, a brand and whole markets change with time. 
1. Development stage (planning and design stage) - The product is designed and developed during this stage. Prototypes may be produced. Manufacturing processes will also be created, including any special machinery required to make the product. Cash flow will be negative at this stage, as no revenue is generated. 2. Introduction phase/launch - Special pricing strategies may be used during the launch of a new product, such as market skimming or market penetration. Companies must also consider that the pricing strategy used at the introductory stage may affect demand in later years. For example, setting a low price initially may discourage competitors from entering the market. This will allow the company to enjoy higher demand later in the product lifecycle. 3. Growth - Competition may rise due to new suppliers entering the market. This may force lower prices. 4. Maturity - Most profits are made during this phase. Prices may be stable. The company's price strategy during this phase is more likely to focus on maximising short-term profits, unlike in the introduction phase. 5. Decline - Prices may fall with demand unless a niche market can be found. In the modern manufacturing environment, many of a product's costs will be incurred at the early stages of its lifecycle (e.g. development, design and set-up costs). Revenues only arise, however, when the product is being manufactured and sold. Traditional financial and management accounting systems focus only on costs and revenues incurred during the manufacturing stage of the product's life. They therefore, ignore the following: · costs incurred in developing and designing the product; and . any abandonment and disposal costs at the end of the product's life. Life-cycle costing estimates and accumulates costs over a product's entire lifecycle to determine whether the profits earned during the manufacturing stage will cover the costs incurred pre- and post-manufacturing. It traces individual products' development, design and set-up costs over their lifecycles. 

Example of Life-Cycle Costing 
Zany developed a new computer game during the year 20X2 for $200,000. The game will be launched in the year 20X3. Budgeted revenues and costs of the game over its lifecycle (life-cycle costing) are presented below:

|                           | 20X2               | 20X3   | 20X4   | 20X5   |
| Sales (units)             | 0                  | 16,000 | 34,000 | 12,000 |
|                           | $000               | $000   | $000   | $000   |
| Revenue                   | 0                  | 160    | 340    | 120    |
| Variable costs            | 0                  | 30     | 65     | 20     |
| Contribution              | 0                  | 130    | 275    | 100    |
| Marketing costs           | 40                 | 30     | 0      | 0      |
| Development costs         | 200                | 0      | 0      | 0      |
| Annual profit             | (240)              | 100    | 275    | 100    |
| Cumulative profit         | (240)              | (140)  | 135    | 235    |
| Life-cycle cost per unit: | $000               |        |        |        |
| Total variable costs      | 115 (30 + 65 + 20) |        |        |        |
| Marketing costs           | 70 (40 + 30)       |        |        |        |
| Development costs         | 200                |        |        |        |
| Total life-cycle costs    | 385                |        |        |        |
| Total output (000 units)  | 62                 |        |        |        |
| Life-cycle cost per unit  | $6.21              |        |        |        |

Since the selling price is $10 per unit, life-cycle profit per unit = $3.79 ($10-$6.21). Managers can now see the expected profit of the product over its entire life rather than simply on a year- by-year basis. Actual revenues and costs would be presented on a comparable basis. The life-cycle cost per unit includes all costs, not just manufacturing-related. 

3.2 Costs Involved 
For life-cycle costing, three stages can be identified in the product's lifecycle: 
· Planning and design stage; 
· Manufacturing (or production and sales) stage; 
· Service and abandonment stage. 

3.2.1 Committed Costs During the planning and design phase, many decisions about the product's design will determine the costs that will be incurred in the future. These are committed costs. Although not incurred during the design phase, the company is committed to incurring future expenditures (mainly during manufacturing). Tools such as target costing (see previous) may be used to reduce such committed costs, if they exceed what is acceptable. The pattern of expenditure will vary from industry to industry. It is common for committed costs during the planning and design phase to reach 80% of the total costs over the product's life.

3.2.2 Cost Behaviour in the Product Lifecycle The actual costs incurred during the product lifecycle typically include the following: 

| Stage                   | Fixed Costs                                                                          | Variable Costs                                      |
| Planning and design     | · Product design   									 |					               |
|			  | · Building prototypes   								 |						       |
|			  | · Market research                                                                    |                              		       |                                             

| Manufacturing and sales | · Marketing and advertising 							 |· Materials and components    	       	       |
|			  | · Fixed production and sales overheads						 |· Direct labour				       |
|		          | · Design updating 								         |· Variable production and non- production overheads. |
														 |· Sales commissions				       |	
| Service and abandonment | · Decommissioning factories 
			    · Disposal of products                                  				 | · Servicing (may be outsourced)                     |
During the manufacturing and design phase, costs are likely to change as follows: 
· Marketing and advertising costs will initially be high when the product is first launched and for some time after this, in which the manufacturer will want to raise market awareness. Later, the costs of marketing and advertising will fall. 
· Fixed production costs may also be higher in the initial manufacturing stages. Later, the manufacturing experience gained may enable cost savings to be made. However, some fixed costs may be stepped costs and increase if production increases through expanding production facilities. 
· Total variable costs will, by definition, increase as output increases. The output will be expected to grow at least during the start of the sales and manufacturing phase as demand for the product increases. 
· Unit manufacturing costs calculated using traditional absorption costing will decrease as output increases, due to two factors: 1. The fixed costs will be spread over a more significant number of units, leading to a lower fixed cost per unit; and 2. The variable cost per unit may fall as output increases due to economies of scale and the learning effect. 

3.2.3 Strategies to Extend Product Maturity The life-cycle cost per unit can be reduced by extending the maturity of the product. The following strategies can be used for this: 
· Issuing updated versions of the product, which include new features. The costs of developing updates for an existing product are likely considerably less than the cost of creating an entirely new product. 
· Repackaging the product to give it a new image. This way, established products can be relaunched as if they were new. 
· Selling the product in new markets. This could be new geographical markets or aiming the product at new market segments (e.g. by discounting the price). 

3.3 Benefits 
Life-cycle costing encourages management to plan the pricing strategy for the whole product life rather than on a short-term basis. (Pricing and the effect of the product lifecycle on pricing decisions are discussed later in Chapter 7.) 
Identifying the costs incurred throughout the product's life means that management understands them better, enabling management to control them better. 
By monitoring a product's revenues and costs on a cumulative basis over its life, management is provided with more meaningful information for control than it would have by monitoring costs and revenues period by period. 
It is much easier to "design out costs" during the design phase of a product than to "control out costs" later in a product's lifecycle. By considering the whole lifecycle of the product at the design phase, management is more likely to achieve a reasonable cost base and, therefore, reasonable profits. Decisions about whether to continue developing and manufacturing products will be based on complete information when the product lifecycle is considered. Where costs and revenues are monitored on a period-by-period basis, there is a risk that products in the development phase will be scrapped because they do not bring in revenues. 

3.4 Relevance to Service Industries 
Life-cycle costing is relevant to services that require significant upfront research and development. An example is the software industry, where considerable research and development are invested in a new application or operating system. The cost of this development must be recovered before the software becomes obsolete. Life-cycle costing can also be performed concerning customers. The costs of providing goods or services to customers may vary over their "life" as customers. Some businesses incur high costs in setting up a new customer. However, having attracted new business, the cost of maintaining a customer relationship is likely to be much lower. An effort is therefore directed to ensuring customer loyalty. For example, the following one-off costs might be incurred by a retail bank at the start of a new customer's life: 
· Financial incentives (e.g. below-market-rate interest on borrowings for 12 months). 
· Initial registration, including validation of personal details and identification documents. 
· Creditworthiness checks if loans are to be provided. 
· Setting up bank account access. · Issuing user IDs and passwords for Internet banking. 
Once the customer's accounts have been set up, many of the costs above will not need to be incurred again. The bank must ensure that the expenses incurred at the start are recovered over the customer's life. 

4.1 The Theory of Constraints During the 1980s, many factories in Western Europe and the US became heavily automated. At that time, there was a general belief that automation would reduce costs (by reducing labour) and higher profits. Management accountants, therefore, focused on performance measures of efficiency. However, many businesses did not enjoy increased profits despite improved efficiency. Instead, they discovered the following problems: 
· They failed to meet customer orders on time, leading to customer frustration. 
· The volume of work-in-progress and finished goods grew significantly, leading to high inventory obsolescence costs and a lack of storage space in factories. 

Goldratt and Cox, in their book, "The Goal", pointed out that the cause of the apparent paradox between increased efficiency and reduced profits was production bottlenecks. Bottlenecks are slower processes than those that precede and succeed them. They slow down the whole production process. 
Example of Bottleneck 
A factory makes three products, all of which pass through three machines. The time spent on each machine is the same for all three products. Demand for the company's products exceeds the amount that the company can produce. The maximum daily output of the three machines is as follows: 
Machine 1 200 units -> Machine 2 180 units -> Machine 3 210 units 
Machine 2 is the bottleneck, which has the lowest output volume. 
Goldratt and Cox pointed out the following: 
· If the non-bottleneck processes operate at maximum efficiency, work-in-progress will build up before the bottleneck process. In this example, if Machine 1 continues to produce 200 units a day, 20 incomplete units a day will accumulate in front of Machine 2, which can only deal with 180 units daily.  
· The bottlenecks restrict the input quantity to the "downstream" processes. In this example, Machine 3 can only process 180 units a day, as this is all it receives as input from Machine 2. Bottlenecks reduce the rate at which finished goods are produced. The problem was worse because factories would set up machines for large production runs. After producing a large batch of one product, the machines must be set up for a different product. It was thought that large batches would reduce costs further by reducing set-up costs. However, it compounded the problems of a build-up of work-inprogress and the delays in meeting customer order deadlines. Goldratt and Cox concluded that organisations should focus on "throughput" (i.e. producing for sale, not work-in-progress) instead of focusing on efficiency. Throughput is the rate at which the system generates money through sales. Goldratt and Cox proposed the following process ("the five focusing steps") to maximise profit when faced with bottlenecks: 1. Identify the system's bottlenecks. This will be more complex in the real world than the simplified example here. 2. Decide how to exploit the bottlenecks identified in (1) (i.e. which products to make, given the bottlenecks). Ensuring the bottleneck resource is actively used requires limiting factor analysis using the time spent on the bottleneck as the limiting factor. By definition, the non-bottleneck resources will not be used at full capacity and, therefore, must sit idle for some time. 3. Subordinate everything else to the decisions made in (2) (i.e. ensure that other resources do not produce at a higher rate than the bottleneck). In this example, if Machine 1 were to operate at its maximum capacity of 200 units per day, Machine 2 would only be able to take 180 units, so 20 units of work-in- progress would build up. In this case, Machine 1 should be subordinated to the speed of Machine 2, and its production speed should be limited to 180 units. 4. Elevate the system's bottlenecks (i.e. elevate production capacity). This can be done, for example, by buying additional machines (capital investment), training the machine operators or reducing the time spent on the bottleneck resource. It may be possible to redeploy available idle time hours from a subordinated resource from step (3) to help alleviate the bottleneck. 5. If a new constraint is broken in (4), return to (1). Once the bottleneck has been removed, another resource becomes the bottleneck (as long as there is market demand). For example, if the capacity of Machine 2 were increased to 240 units per day, Machine 1 would become the bottleneck. Steps 1-4 are repeated. Therefore, this is a process of continuous improvement. 
The ideas above conflict with traditional management accounting: 
· The idea that Machine A should not operate at full capacity would lead to the idle time of the operators of Machine A. Goldratt and Cox argue that idle time must be accepted as the cost of idle time is less than the cost of the work-in-progress which would build up if Machine A were to operate at full capacity. 
· Under traditional management accounting, the build-up of work-in-progress would not affect the business's profits (since closing work-in-progress is part of closing inventory and deducted in determining the cost of sales). Goldratt and Cox argue that this is wrong because the build-up of work-in-progress in front of a bottleneck is a cost to the company if the volume of work-in-progress continually increases. 

4.2 Throughput Contribution 
Throughput contribution - sales revenue less direct material costs. 
Goldratt and Cox introduced the idea of "throughput contribution" as the measure of performance. They argue that all other costs, traditionally treated as variable, are fixed in the short run (e.g. labour). When using limiting factor analysis (see also Chapter 6) to determine which products to produce, given a bottleneck, they would advocate prioritising the production of those products that generate maximum throughput contribution per bottleneck hour. 
Key Point 
The fixed elements in this technique include overheads and labour, which may collectively termed "conversion costs".

Quiz: Limiting Factor Analysis 
Beta Co produces three products, E, F and G, all in the same factory, details of which are shown below: 
|                                                           | E      | F      | G      |
| Selling price per unit ($)                                | 120    | 110    | 130    |
| Direct material cost per unit ($)                         | 60     | 70     | 85     |
| Maximum demand (units)                                    | 30,000 | 25,000 | 40,000 |
| Time required on the bottleneck resource (hours per unit) | 5      | 4      | 3      |

There are 320,000 bottleneck hours available each month. 
Required: Calculate the optimum product mix each month. 

Answer:
Step 1: Calculate the throughput per unit for each product. 
Step 2: Calculate the throughput return per hour of bottleneck resource. 
Step 3: Rank products in order of production priority (i.e. highest return per hour first). 
|                                                                   | E  | F  | G  |
| 1. Throughput per unit = Selling price - direct material cost ($) | 60 | 40 | 45 |
| Time required on the bottleneck resource (hours per unit)         | 5  | 4  | 3  |
| 2. Return per factory hour ($)                                    | 12 | 10 | 15 |
| 3. Rank                                                           | 2  | 3  | 1  |
Note: Product E has the highest throughput per unit, while product G has the highest per hour. Therefore, the bottleneck must be exploited by prioritising G before E. 
Step 4: Calculate the optimum production plan (i.e., allocating the bottleneck resource to each product in order, not exceeding their maximum demand). 
| Product               | Units  | Hours | Total     | Throughput per hour | Total throughput |
| Total hours available |        |       | 320,000   |                     |                  |
| G                     | 40,000 | 3     | (120,000) | $15                 | $1,800,000       |
| E                     | 30,000 | 5     | (150,000) | $12                 | $1,800,000       |
| F                     | 12,500 | 4     | (50,000)  | $10                 | $500,000         |
|                       |        |       |           |                     | $4,100,000       |
320,000 hours is sufficient to produce 40,000 units (maximum demand) of G (first) and E (second), leaving only 50,000 hours for making 12,500 units of F.

Quiz: Throughput Contribution 
A factory produces two products, A and B. Both products pass through three processes: Process 1, Process 2 and Process 3. Process 2 has been identified as the bottleneck. There are 10 hours of Process 2 time available per day. Information relating to the two products is as follows: 
|                                    | A   | B   |
| $                                  | $   |
| Selling price per unit             | 100 | 80  |
| Direct materials per unit          | 70  | 60  |
| Direct labour per unit             | 5   | 10  |
| Traditional contribution per unit  | 25  | 10  |
| Maximum demand per day             | 8   | 14  |
| Time on Process 2 per unit (hours) | 1   | 0.5 |

Required: Determine the daily production plan that would maximise throughput contribution. 

Answer:
|                                         | A   | B   |
|                                         | $   | $   |
| Selling price per unit                  | 100 | 80  |
| Direct materials per unit               | 70  | 60  |
| Throughput contribution per unit        | 30  | 20  |
| Time on Process 2 per unit (hours)      | 1   | 0.5 |
| Throughput return per hour of Process 2 | 30  | 40  |
| Ranking                                 | 2   | 1   |

|                                                     | Units produced | Hours used |
| B:                                                  | 14             | 7          |
| A:                                                  | 3              | 3          |
|                                                     |                | 10         |
| Total throughput contribution: (14 × 20) + (3 × 30) |                | 370        |

Note: There are only three Process 2 hours remaining after prioritising production of Product B, which is sufficient for making three units of Product A (which requires one Process 2 hour per unit).

4.3 Throughput Accounting Ratio ("TPAR") 
4.3.1 Calculation Based on the ideas of the theory of constraints, Galloway and Waldron developed the throughput accounting ratio ("TPAR") as a performance measure to evaluate factory managers. This aims to motivate factory managers to focus on maximising throughput. The ratio is calculated as follows: 
TPAR = Return per factory hour /Cost per factory hour 
Return per factory hour= Throughput per unit/Hours of bottleneck resource used per unit  
Cost per factory hour = Other factory costs/Bottleneck resource hours available  
Other factory costs mean all costs incurred in the factory besides materials; since materials are considered the only truly variable costs, all other costs are fixed. Return per factory hour is throughput contribution per unit divided by time spent on the bottleneck, where materials are the only variable cost. The TPAR, therefore, shows: Contribution per hour/Fixed cost per hour 

4.3.2 Interpreting TPAR 
TPAR is interpreted as follows: 
· If TPAR > 1, the product is profitable, as the throughput contribution exceeds the fixed costs. 
· If TPAR = 1, the product breaks even. 
· If TPAR < 1, the product is loss-making. The throughput contribution generated does not cover the fixed costs required to make it. 

4.3.3 Ways to Improve the TPAR TPAR is a performance measurement tool that may be used in evaluating managers' performance. It is hoped that managers will take the following actions to increase their measured performance: 
· Eliminate bottlenecks or reduce the time spent on bottleneck resources. 
· Reduce other factory costs. 
Mathematically, the ratio could also be improved by increasing selling prices or reducing material costs. However, increasing selling prices may not be feasible in a competitive environment. Reducing material costs may affect quality, so this may not be desirable. 


5.1 Introduction
In recent decades environmental issues have become more prominent. Environmental groups and many scientists point to evidence of human activity causing global warming and warn of the dire consequences of climate change. The most pressing issues are:
· Global warming, caused by greenhouse gas emissions (measured by the “carbon footprint”).
· The global reserves of scarce natural resources are being depleted. In particular, energy and water will become scarce over the next 50 years.
· Pollution and rising sea levels causing loss of habitats for many species.

5.2 Importance of the Environment for Business 
5.2.1 Environmental Behaviour and Performance One of the pioneering articles on environmental management accounting was "The Green Bottom Line: Management Accounting for Environmental Improvement and Business Benefit", published by Martin Bennett and Peter James in 1998. This identified several ways in which a company can improve its performance by becoming more aware of the impact on the environment: 
· Poor environmental behaviour can harm an organisation's image, which may lead to a loss of sales as customers boycott the organisation's products. 
· Many governments may impose heavy fines on companies which harm the environment. Companies also may have to pay hefty amounts to clean up any pollution for which they are responsible. 
· Increasing government regulations on environmental issues such as pollution has increased business compliance costs. 
· Improving environmental behaviour can reduce costs. For example, increasing energy efficiency will reduce energy costs and the depletion of natural resources for the companies concerned. 
· Businesses as corporate citizens have a moral duty to play their part in helping to reduce the harm they do to the environment. 
Example
The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in April 2010 was one of the world's worst environmental disasters. An exploratory oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to a partially capped oil well a mile below the water's surface. Experts estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil leaked from this well daily, depending on weather conditions. It took approximately three months to re-seal the oil well and stop the leak. BP was the majority owner of the oilfield. Although the rig was operated by a sub-contractor on behalf of BP, the US government stated that it held BP primarily responsible for the leak. BP recognised a pre-tax cost of $40.9 billion in its 2010 financial statements relating to the oil spill (compared with a profit for the year 2009 of $16.6. billion). This included a fund of $20 billion, which was set up to compensate the local community for damages caused and costs incurred on cleaning up the spill. 

5.2.2 Achieving Environmental Benefits Bennett and James suggested six ways in which business and environmental benefits could be obtained through environmental management accounting: 1. Taking account of environmental effects in making capital expenditure decisions. 2. Better understanding of environmental costs otherwise hidden in other overheads that management is unaware of. 3. Reducing waste and saving energy. 4. Understanding environmental effects on life-cycle costs, many of which are incurred at the end of a product's life (e.g. to dispose of electronic goods following local laws on recycling). 5. Measuring environmental performance as stakeholders become more interested in organisations' environmental impact. 6. Involving management accountants in longer-term strategic planning for environmental-related issues. 

5.3 Environmental Management Accounting Traditional management accounting systems do not provide any analysis of environmental costs. Management is often unaware of them. The implication of this is that: 
· Management cannot do enough to manage environmental activities. 
· Management accounts underestimate the costs of poor environmental behaviour and the benefits of good environmental behaviour. 

Environmental Management Accounting (EMA) aims to overcome this.
EMA - the identification, collection, analysis and use of two types of information for internal decision- making: physical information on the use, flows and rates of energy, water and materials (including wastes); and monetary information on environment-related costs, earnings and savings. - Environmental Management Accounting Research and Information Centre (EMARIC) It is important to remember that there are two aspects to environmental management accounting: 
· Physical information, which focuses on the physical use of scarce resources and how much waste occurs. 
· Monetary information on environment-related costs, earnings and savings. 

5.4 Defining Environmental Costs The first step in dealing with environmental costs is to define what environmental costs mean. Various definitions or categories of environmental costs have been suggested. One of these is the definitions provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which identified the following types of environmental costs: 
· Conventional costs: environmental-related costs (e.g., buying energy and other scarce resources). 
· Potentially hidden costs: those environmental costs that are recorded but included in general overheads, so management is unaware of them. 
· Contingent costs: potential future costs (e.g., cleaning up damage caused by pollution). (In financial statements, contingent costs might be disclosed as contingent liabilities or recognised as provisions.) . 
· Image and relationship costs: incurred producing environmental reports and promoting the company's environmental activities. 
An alternative categorisation of environmental costs proposed by Hansen and Mendova is based on the costs of quality: 
· Environmental prevention costs are incurred by activities undertaken to prevent waste production (e.g. spending on redesigning processes to reduce the amount of pollution released into the atmosphere). 
· Environmental detection costs are incurred to ensure that the organisation complies with regulations and voluntary standards (e.g. costs of auditing the organisation's environmental activities). 
· Environmental internal failure costs are incurred to clean up environmental waste and pollution before it has been released into the environment (e.g. costs of disposing of toxic waste). 
· Environmental external failure costs are incurred on activities performed after discharging waste into the environment (e.g., cleaning up an ocean after spilling oil). 

5.5 EMA Techniques 
Having identified the various environmental costs, it is necessary to provide useful information to management to help manage and control environmental activities - to save money and reduce the harm caused by operations to the environment. Various tools have been proposed for this: 
· An environmental cost report based on the costs defined by Hansen and Mendova, with each category of costs shown as a percentage of revenues. 
· Environmental activity-based costing. 
· Input-output analysis. 
· Flow cost accounting. 
· Life-cycle costing. 

5.5.1 Environmental Activity-Based Costing 
Environmental activity-based costing applies ABC principles to environmental costs so that the environmental costs are apportioned "correctly" to the products that use the drivers causing the costs to be incurred. Environmental costs are often hidden in general overheads and, therefore, apportioned to products using inappropriate drivers. This can mean that product costs do not truly reflect the environmental costs of making them. 
Under environmental ABC: 
· Environment-related costs are attributed to joint environmental cost centres such as sewage plants or incinerators. 
· Environment-driven costs, on the other hand, are hidden in general overheads (although they vary with the amount of throughput) and do not relate directly to a joint environmental cost centre. Such costs are allocated to environmental activities using the activity's drivers. For example, the cost of monitoring emissions may be driven by waste emissions in kilograms. The costs of tracking emissions can then be apportioned to products based on kilograms of emissions produced by each product. 
The main methods of allocating these environment-driven costs (the allocation keys) might be the following: 
· Volume of emissions or waste; 
· Toxicity of emission and waste treated; 
· Volume of emission treated; 
· The relative costs of treating different types of emissions. 

Example of Environmental ABC 
ABC may be used to more accurately ascertain the costs of washing towels at a hotel. The energy used to power the washing machines is an environmental cost; the cost driver is "washing". Hotel management may drive change towards more "environmentally-friendly" use of towels by: 
· Publishing its environmental policy; 
· Providing fewer towels in rooms and requiring guests to contact housekeeping for additional towels; 
· Promoting habit ("Reuse me again tomorrow - just like at home") rather than playing on environmental concerns. 
As well as energy savings, carbon emissions and water consumption will be reduced. Also, for example, staff time to collect and return towels and operate the machines will be less, and since the towels are washed less frequently, they will need to be replaced by new ones less often. As most towels are manufactured from cotton (a crop), this will also help conserve natural resources. 

5.5.2 Input-Output Analysis Management may use input-output analysis of "mass balance" to clarify how much waste their activities generate. The aim is to compare the output of a production process (in physical units) with the input on the basis that "what comes in must go out". What is not included in the output must, therefore, be waste. Process flows are often used to show these more specifically. For example: 
INPUT 100% -> PROCESS -> 60% Product, 20% Scrap for recycling, 15% Disposal as waste, 5% Not accounted for 

5.5.3 Flow Cost Accounting 
Flow cost accounting is a more detailed version of input-output analysis. Input-output analysis considers only the physical inputs and ensures that these are accounted for as physical outputs at the end of the production process. Flow cost accounting considers the inputs and outputs for each process, to identify the waste for each process. Flow cost accounting examines the physical quantities of material and the costs and values of output and waste for each process. Input costs are calculated and apportioned between the production and waste using process costing principles. The costs used in flow cost accounting are sometimes categorised as follows: 
· material costs; 
· system costs - incurred within the various processes that add value to the product (e.g. wages and overheads); and 
· delivery and disposal costs - are incurred in delivering goods to customers or disposing of waste.

5.5.4 Relevance of Life-Cycle Costing Life-cycle costing is particularly relevant for environmental costs because many environmental costs are not incurred during the production phase. Clean-up costs may be high but are only incurred after the production process is finished. The European Union's "End of Life Vehicles Directive" makes it compulsory for car manufacturers in the EU to collect and dispose of old cars that have reached the end of their useful life. Therefore, manufacturers should consider such costs during life-cycle costing exercises. 

Example:
Xerox Corporation leases photocopying machines to clients. The machines are returned to the company at the end of their lives. One cost which had previously been ignored was the cost of packaging. Xerox would provide packaging for new machines delivered to the customer. The customer would then dispose of this packaging and have to pay to re-pack the old machine, which was being returned to Xerox. As a result of including the costs of packaging in the life-cycle costs of photocopying, the company could see how significant these costs were. The company now uses a standard reusable pack. When a machine is delivered to a customer, the package in which it is delivered is used to pack the old machine, which is being returned to Xerox. Two standard types of packing have been developed, which cover all of Xerox's machines. This led to a reduction in packaging costs and increased customer satisfaction. 

6.1 Accounting for Environmental and Sustainability Factors Accountants must be able to link sustainability to the broader business agenda by highlighting elements that build resilience and develop a sustainable strategy. There is increasing demand from society that organisations be held responsible for a range of sustainability issues, which will ultimately affect their financial performance and ability to generate value over time. Accountants play a central role in helping organisations navigate these opportunities and risks. 
Sustainability - meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. - United Nations Bruntland Commission (1987) 
Sustainable development requires organisations to consider the long-term consequences of their decisions. Investors increasingly use Environment, Social and Governance ("ESG") information to gauge a business's long-term value creation potential and sustainability. This is evident from the increasing number of investors signing up for ESG-dominated investment strategies and the proposition of ESG resolutions from shareholders. Organisations that successfully demonstrate their capability in deploying ESG activities, accounting and disclosures will attract such investors. 

6.2 Sustainability Strategy Perspectives 
A sustainability strategy means building value for shareholders while contributing to the needs of a sustainable society. Therefore, the accounting process supporting this mandate must account for the multiple perspectives required to inform the necessary decisions. This requires an integrated and externally-oriented focus on what truly drives sustainability within the organisation, with a focus on four perspectives: 
· Value creation from capitals 
· Stakeholder perspectives 
· Megatrends affecting opportunities and threats 
· Customer preferences 

6.3 Role of Accountants in Developing Sustainable Practices 
A report by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) Accounting for Sustainability lists actions that professional accountants can focus on to drive sustainability in their organisation: 
· Identify and connect trends and impacts vital to the organisation and the connection to the organisation's strategy, business model and performance. 
· Integrate significant natural and social capital issues into management information to formulate strategies, plans, targets and investment decisions. 
· Assess the benefits of responding to environmental and social matters, for example, how they contribute to value creation, cost reduction, or revenue generation, as well as other benefits, such as making the organisation more attractive to employees or improving its reputation. 
· Organise systems, processes and people to support decision-making and ensure that what matters gets measured and managed. 
· Link to value creation to ensure resources are used effectively in creating value for shareholders, customers and other stakeholders. 
· Drive efficiency by reducing waste and lowering costs. 
· Provide credibility to data and information through effective governance and oversight. 
· Communicate clearly to facilitate transparency through stakeholder communications and disclosures supported by appropriate reporting frameworks, such as integrated reporting. 
These actions are centred on three main areas: Leadership and Business Strategy Management, Operations and Accounting Communications, Reporting and Disclosure 

Area: Leadership and Business Strategy
Aspects: Make sustainability strategic, not just tactical Finance has the skills and ability to support the business to ensure sustainability initiatives are strategic rather than tactical: 
· Identifying the business case at an organisational, project or issue level; 
· Facilitate leadership and commitment; 
· Engage the finance and accounting function; 
· Connecting sustainability to strategy, risk and performance and identifying how decisions can be enhanced by integrating sustainability-related information into business planning, risk and performance management and investment appraisal. 

Area: Management, Operations and Accounting 
Aspect: Improve the process of information and data collection, analysis and reporting Finance professionals bring the rigour and discipline used in accounting to collect, analyse and report sustainability data. They need to work closely with sustainability professionals and others to understand what information needs to be captured and how it will be used: 
· Generating information and analysis to support decisions; 
· Reducing the sustainability impact of products, services and operations. 

Area: Communications, Reporting and Disclosure 
Aspect: Integrate with reporting Finance professionals are best placed to incorporate meaningful sustainability performance information into business reporting processes and disclosures and to inform stakeholders of an organisation's ability to create value over time: 
· Developing a business reporting strategy and approach; 
· Integrating sustainability impacts into financial reporting; 
· Assuring Sustainability Disclosures and Reports. 

Summary:
· The business environment within which companies operate has become more competitive. Products have shorter lifecycles, and there is an emphasis on quality.
· New management accounting techniques have evolved to meet this new environment.
· Target costing attempts to achieve an acceptable margin when the price of a product or service is determined externally by the market. It can be used during the design phase of a new product (to "design out" costs).
· Techniques that may be used in closing a target gap include: Tear down analysis (“reverse engineering”); Value engineering; and Functional analysis.
· Life-cycle costing involves tracking the cumulative costs and revenues through the states of a product from development to abandonment. It encourages management to plan the pricing strategy for a product over its life rather than the short term.
· According to the theory of constraints there is always at least one constraint (a bottleneck) that limits the achievement of a goal.
· Throughput accounting draws management’s attention to bottleneck processes.
    - Throughput contribution means sales revenue less material cost.
    - Throughput accounting aims to maximise the throughput generated per hour by eliminating bottlenecks.
    - A product breaks even if its throughput accounting ratio (TPAR) is 1.
· Environmental management accounting (EMA) provides management with monetary and non-monetary (physical) information, enabling them to understand and manage the environmental impact of the organisation's activities.
· Environmental costs include: Conventional costs; Potentially hidden costs; Contingent costs; and Image and relationship costs.
· EMA techniques include input/output analysis, ABC, and life-cycle costing.
· Accountants must be able to link sustainability to the broader business agenda by highlighting elements that build resilience and develop a sustainable strategy.


Chapter 4: Relevant Cost Analysis
This chapter covers the following Learning Outcomes. C. Decision-Making Techniques 1. Relevant cost analysis a. Explain the concept of relevant costing. b. Identify and calculate relevant costs for a specific decision situation from given data. c. Explain and apply the concept of opportunity costs. 2. Make-or-buy and other short-term decisions a. Explain the issues surrounding make v buy and outsourcing decisions. b. Calculate and compare "make" costs with "buy-in" costs. c. Compare in-house costs and outsource costs of completing tasks and consider other issues surrounding this decision. d. Apply relevant costing principles in situations involving shut down, one-off contracts and the further processing of joint products.

1.1 Meaning 
Key Point Relevant costs are those costs that are affected by a specific management decisions. 
Only those costs and revenues affected by a decision are "relevant". Relevant costs are: 
· future costs and revenues; historical costs and revenues are not relevant, as they have already been incurred; 
· incremental (i.e. the amount by which costs/revenues will change due to the decision); if a course of action is not taken, incremental costs will be saved; and 
· cash flows (i.e. cash payments or receipts). Non-cash expenses and income are not relevant as they represent expenditure already made. For example, depreciation is a non-cash expense arising from the accounting treatment of an asset already acquired. A future decision does not change that acquisition. Profit or loss on disposal is similarly a non-cash item and, therefore, irrelevant. However, cash proceeds received on the disposal of an asset would be relevant if incremental to a decision. (This is detailed in s.3.4.) The following costs are relevant: 
· Avoidable costs (i.e. those which would be avoided if a particular course of action were taken); and 
· Controllable costs that can be influenced by the actions of the person who controls the budget or cost centre (also called "managed costs"). 
Variable production materials costs are incremental; if production increases, the costs of materials and labour, etc., increase. Fixed production costs that do not increase are not incremental and are therefore irrelevant.

Quiz: Incremental Costs Hide The banqueting department of the Grey Gables Hotel organises special events. Next month a wedding reception will be held in the hotel. An assistant accountant has prepared a schedule detailing the cost of the wedding as follows:
|                           | Note | $     | Solution Yes/No |
| Food and drinks           |      | 1,500 |                 |
| Servers' wages            | 1    | 200   |                 |
| Supervisor's salary       | 2    | 100   |                 |
| Flowers                   |      | 500   |                 |
| Administration            | 3    | 300   |                 |
| Cleaning of function room | 4    | 200   |                 |
| Room rental               | 5    | 200   |                 |
| Central management costs  | 6    | 300   |                 |
| Total costs               |      | 3,300 |                 |
Notes 1. The servers are not regular employees and work only when required for functions. They are paid $20 per day and ten servers would be needed for the wedding. 2. The supervisor is a full-time hotel employee paid a fixed salary. The charge here is a portion of his basic salary for the time he will spend supervising the event. 3. Administration costs relate to the time spent by the banqueting department organising the event. All staff members in this department are full-time employees and are paid a fixed salary. 4. An external cleaning company cleans the function rooms before and after an event. It charges $200 per event. 5. The wedding reception will be held in Grey Gable's banqueting room. A notional rental charge for the space has been added. The hotel building is rented from a property company for a fixed annual rental. 6. When costing an event, the accounting department adds 10% to the cost of each event to cover central hotel management costs. 
Required: Indicate whether or not each of the costs in the accountant's schedule is incremental.

1.2 Non-relevant Costs 
Sunk costs- the historical cost of an asset is a past cost (money already spent) and said to be "sunk"; it is irrelevant to any decision. Examples of sunk costs include research and development costs already incurred and market research. 
Committed costs (e.g. contract rental and lease payments) are similarly irrelevant - although future and cash flows, they are not incremental (even though they are future cash flows). However, if a contract is cancellable, such payments are not committed, and any penalty costs incurred in cancelling the contract would be relevant. 
Fixed costs, incurred regardless of the decision being taken, are irrelevant (but an increment "step" in a fixed cost will be relevant). Allocations and apportionments of fixed costs (and similarly shared costs) are subjective (even arbitrary) and irrelevant to decisions. Depreciation/amortisation and carrying values are irrelevant. 
Depreciation (also amortisation) is not a cash flow but a method of accounting for past capital expenditure. By the same argument, book values are not relevant as these are simply the result of historical costs and depreciation. Any realisable value of an asset (an incremental, future cash flow) would, however, be relevant (see s.3.4). 
Uncontrollable ("non-controllable") costs can only be influenced indirectly by the person in charge of the budget or cost centre. Typically, these include "management charges" (i.e. reallocated non-production overheads). Similarly, notional costs (e.g. recharges of head office costs or management charges), which do not increase as a result of the decision, are irrelevant. 

2.1 Definition 
Opportunity cost - "The value of the benefit sacrificed when one course of action is chosen, in preference to an alternative. The opportunity cost is represented by the foregone potential benefit from the best rejected course of action." - CIMA Official Terminology (Chartered Institute of Management Accountants) 
Opportunity costs apply to the use of scarce resources; where resources are not scarce, no sacrifice results from using them. For example, the contribution a key worker is moved to a new project the contribution the worker would have generated if they had not been moved is an opportunity cost relevant to the new project. 

2.2 Importance 
Key Point
All opportunity costs are "relevant". However, only some relevant costs are opportunity costs. 
Example of Opportunity Cost 
A company has been invited to tender for a contract to produce a component, R2D2. Production of R2D2 will require 100 hours of processing on Machine X. If Machine X is currently working at full capacity producing 50 units of Product Z an hour. Each unit of Product Z makes a contribution of $2. If 100 hours of Machine X time is used to fulfil the new contract the lost contribution of $10,000 (50 * $2 * 100) is an opportunity cost of producing R2D2 and should be taken into account when deciding how much to tender for the contract. 

2.3 Difficulties in Using Opportunity Costs 
Although the main benefit of an opportunity cost approach to decision making is that it recognises and takes into account what is given up by not selecting the next best alternative, it is not without difficulties: x How to estimate future costs/revenues and hence the benefit sacrificed. 
· Identifying alternative uses to know what is the best alternative foregone. 
· Lack of accounting for effects on accounting profit (i.e. accounting profits do not include opportunity costs and revenues). A course that reduces the reported accounting profit may be considered unacceptable even though it is the best decision under opportunity cost principles. 
· Also, as is true for any costing method, it ignores non-financial factors (see s.3.5). 

3.0 Introduction 
One decision-making scenario is to decide how much to tender for a one-off contract. To make the decision, it is necessary to consider all the relevant costs of the contract to ensure that the revenue from the contract covers them. This section provides further guidance concerning materials, labour and non-current assets which may be required for such contracts. 

3.1 Minimum Price The minimum price that makes a contract worthwhile is equal to the relevant cost. At this price no profit or loss would be made on the contract. There are several reasons why a business might wish to know the minimum price of a contract: 
· It is useful for price negotiations to know the lowest price that can be tendered for a contract; if a price is agreed to below the relevant cost, the business will make an actual loss. 
· A business may be prepared to undertake a contract at relevant cost in the hope that this may bring additional business in the future. 
· If a business has under-utilised resources during low season, it may be willing to take on additional contracts at this time (provided that no loss is made) as this may build up goodwill with potential customers. 

3.2 Materials 
Where materials are required for a one-off contract, the following guidance, as summarised in the diagram that follows, can be used to determine the relevant cost: 
· If the materials required have not already been acquired, it will be necessary to buy them for the contract. The current market price is the relevant cost. Historical costs and book values are never relevant costs of materials (as they are "sunk"). 
· If the materials have already been acquired, it is necessary to consider whether they are used regularly in the business: - If used regularly, any materials consumed by the one-off contract will need to be replaced, so the replacement cost (the current market price) would be the relevant cost. - - If used regularly, and replacements are not available, the relevant cost would be the opportunity cost, which would be the contribution foregone from regular production. - If not used regularly (e.g. they were acquired some time ago and there is no current use for them), the relevant cost is their opportunity cost. This is often their scrap value (i.e. disposal proceeds if the materials can be sold if not used in the contract). If there is no scrap value, the opportunity cost is $0. Or there could be an opportunity saving if the materials would otherwise have to be disposed of at a cost.
Exam advice Read exam questions carefully to identify relevant information, which would be needed for the computation, and non-relevant information, which should be either ignored or omitted. Examples of non-relevant information are sunk costs (costs historically incurred), historical purchase prices, and carrying value. 

Example of Raw Materials 
Crocus Co is considering making a new product that requires several types of raw material: 
|            | Units in inventory | Units required | Additional information                                                                                                                                               |
| Material A | 0                  | 40             | Current purchase price is $7/unit.                                                                                                                                   |
| Material B | 100 cost$10/unit   | 150            | Current purchase price is $14/unit. The material has no alternative use other than for the project under consideration. Units in inventory can be sold for $12/unit. |
| Material C | 50 cost $20/unit   | 120            | Current purchase price is $22/unit. The material is used regularly in current manufacturing operations.                                                              |
Material A - As there is no inventory, all 40 units required must be bought at $7 per unit. This is a clear cash outflow caused by the decision to make the new product. Therefore, the relevant cost of Material A for the new product is (40 units * $7) = $280. Material B - The original purchase price ($10) is a sunk cost and so is irrelevant. The 100 units in inventory have no other internal use, so if not used on the new product, it would presumably be sold for $12/unit. If the new product is made, this cash inflow of sale proceeds will be lost. In addition, another 50 units will need to be purchased at $14/unit. The total relevant cost for Material B is therefore: (100 units * $12 (lost sale proceeds)) + (50 units * $14 (current purchase price)) = $1,200+ $700=$1,900 
Material C - As this material is regularly used, any quantity in inventory diverted to the new product will need to be replenished. So, all the units required will have to be purchased; at the current purchase price of $22, this will cost $2,640 (120 units * $22). (As always, the original purchase price is not relevant.)

Quiz: Relevant Costs of Materials 
Hide Bob is a carpenter who makes kitchen furniture. Recently, a customer has asked him to make a special dining room table. This will require the following materials: 
1. 10 square meter of oak wood. Bob already has 20 square meter of oak in his storeroom that he bought last month for $2.50 per square meter. The current price of oak is now $2.75 per m2. Bob frequently uses oak in his work. 
2. Two tins of a particular varnish. Bob does not use this type of varnish regularly, so would have to buy it in. Each tin costs $20. 
3. Four hinges so that the ends of the table can be folded. Bob has four hinges in his storeroom that he acquired some years ago. Bob remembers that the hinges cost $3.00 each. The price of such hinges in a shop today would be $3.50 each. Bob said, "I'm pleased that I can finally use these. They've been in the storeroom for years and if I don't use them on this table, they will stay in the storeroom for many more years. Nobody would want to buy second-hand hinges, would they?" 
Required: Explain what the relevant cost is for each of the three items above. 

Answer:
1. Bob has sufficient oak in his storeroom to make the table. Since he uses oak regularly, any oak used to make the table would have to be replaced. Therefore, the relevant cost is the replacement cost (i.e. the current price of $2.75 per square meter). 
2. Bob would have to buy the tins of varnish specifically for this order, so the relevant cost is the replacement cost (i.e. the current price of $20 a tin). 
3. Bob already has the hinges needed for the table in the storeroom. The question is whether he would replace them if he used them for the table. The information clearly suggests not, as Bob has not used the hinges before. Any scrap value would therefore be the opportunity cost, but this would appear to be zero, as Bob has said that nobody would want to buy second-hand hinges.

3.3 Labour 
One-off contracts usually require some labour. The relevant cost of labour can be determined from the following situations: 
· If the organisation has spare (idle) labour time that can be used on the contract, the relevant cost is zero. This might arise, for example, where workers are being paid a fixed weekly wage and are currently underemployed. 
· If additional labour time is required and can be obtained without taking workers away from other activities, the direct cost of the labour is relevant. This may be paid at a higher rate if overtime is involved. 
· If there is a limit on the amount of labour available, a contract may require workers to be taken away from other profitable activities. In this case, the relevant cost of labour is the direct cost plus the lost contribution from the other activities.

Example of Labour 
Magnolia Co has a new project which requires the following three types of labour: 
|               | Hours  | Additional information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Unskilled     | 12,000 | Paid $8 per hour, and existing staff are fully utilised. New staff must be hired to meet this additional demand.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Semi- skilled | 2,000  | Paid $12 per hour. As these employees are difficult to recruit, Magnolia retains some permanently employed staff, even if there is no work to do. There are 800 hours of idle time currently available. Any additional hours would be fulfilled by temporary staff, who would be paid $14/hour. |
| Skilled       | 8,000  | Paid $15 per hour. As there is a severe shortage of skilled employees, Magnolia would have to move skilled employees from the manufacture of Product X to undertake the project. Each unit of Product X requires 4 hours of labour and generates a contribution of $24/unit.                    |


Relevant costs 
Unskilled - the incremental cash outflow incurred in hiring the new staff necessary for the project is $96,000 (12,000 hours * $8). 
Semi-skilled - Of the 2,000 hours needed, 800 are already available and already being paid for. There is no incremental cost of using spare capacity on the new project. The relevant cost is therefore only for hiring temporary staff, which is $16,800 (1,200 hours * $14). 
Skilled - Consider the calculation of unit contribution for Product X: 
| Revenue            | X
:selected: |
| Materials          | X
:selected: |
| Labour (4 * 15)    | 60           |
| Variable overheads | X
:selected: |
| Contribution       | 24           |
For each unit of X that cannot be produced, Magnolia will lose the revenue but save material and variable overhead costs. Although revenue, material and variable overhead are not known, their net amount must be $84 a unit (60 + 24) or $21 per skilled labour hour ($84/4). This is usually calculated as $15 (current labour cost per hour) plus $6 (lost contribution per hour, $24/4). The relevant cost of skilled labour is therefore $168,000 (8,000 * ($15 + $6)).

Quiz: Relevant Costs of Labour 
Hide Omega Consulting specialises in helping clients implement new accounting software packages. The company has just received a request from a new client to implement a new accounting system, urgently, next week. You have been requested to calculate the relevant cost of the labour that would be required for the project. 1. A project manager would be needed. One project manager, Bill Bates, is available next week. Bill earns a fixed salary equivalent to $1,500 a week. 2. A business consultant would be required to work 30 hours on the contract. All consultants are busy next week. One consultant, Colin Carrington, is scheduled to deliver a training course to a client. This course will generate contribution of $10,000. If the course is cancelled, Colin could work on the new client. Alternatively, the training course could be postponed to the following week, when Colin is available. The client would be charged $5,000 less if the course were delayed a week. Colin is on a fixed weekly salary of $1,000. 3. A technical consultant would be required for 10 hours to install the software and convert the data from the old system. All technical consultants are busy next week, but David Dawson, an experienced technical consultant, said he would be prepared to work overtime. He will work on the new project on Monday and Tuesday and catch up with the 10 hours missed on his existing project the following weekend. David is paid a standard hourly rate of $50 and double time (i.e. $100 an hour) for weekend work. Alternatively, a freelance technical consultant is available. Freelance consultants charge $75 an hour. 4. An analyst would be required for 10 hours to document the new client's system. All analysts are busy next week, but a small project on which Edward Eaves was due to work can be cancelled, which would enable Edward to work on the documentation for the new client. If the other contract is cancelled, contribution of $1,000 would be lost. Edward is paid an hourly rate of $50. 
Required: Explain the relevant cost for each of the four items above. 

Answer:1. The relevant cost of the project manager is zero. Bill Bates, who will manage the new project next week, is paid a fixed salary and has spare time next week. There is, therefore, no additional cost to the company for Bill to manage this project. 2. The relevant cost of the business consultant would be the $5,000 discount given to the other client for agreeing to delay the training course by a week. Colin would have to be taken off a training course, but since he can deliver it a week later, the contribution from that course is not lost, so it is not relevant. (Another way of looking at this is that the contribution is not entirely lost but reduced by $5,000 per the discount). Colin is also on a fixed salary, so will not be paid extra for working on the project. 3. There is a choice here between using the internal technical consultant, David Dawson, or an external consultant. The cost of the external consultant would be $750 (i.e. $75 an hour for 10 hours). If David were to be used, he would have to work overtime. Although the overtime rate of $100 would be incurred while working on his existing project, that overtime rate would only be paid if he were used on the new project, so the cost of using David is $100 an hour. Therefore, as the external consultant is the cheaper option, the relevant cost would be $750. 4. The relevant cost is $1,500, which is the direct cost of Edward's time ($50 * 10) plus the opportunity cost of $1,000. The direct cost of Edward's time is relevant because he is paid an hourly wage of $50, a variable cost. The opportunity cost is the lost contribution on the other project that Edward would have worked on.

3.4 Non-current Assets 
Non-current assets, such as machinery, may be required for a contract. The relevant cost of such assets depends on how the organisation plans to obtain the use of it: 
· If the asset is to be rented (or hired), the rental costs over the period of use are relevant. 
· If the asset is to be acquired (purchased) for the contract, the cost of acquiring the asset (including related costs, such as delivery and installation) would be relevant. It may be that when the contract is completed, the asset can be sold. In this case, the expected proceeds from the sale will be relevant income that should be deducted from the total cost of acquiring the asset when calculating the relevant cost. 
An asset such as the one that is required may already be owned. The relevant cost then depends on whether that asset is already operating at full capacity on other activities. 
· If the asset is not used for other purposes (or has spare capacity), the relevant cost is the fall in realisable value that will arise if the asset is used for the contract. 
· If the asset is already operating at full capacity, its relevant cost is its deprival value (see s.3.4.2). 

3.4.1 Fall in Realisable Value 
Example of Fall in Realisable Value Bob, a builder, owns a crane. He believes he could sell it today for $150,000 in the used-crane market. He is tendering for a contract to renovate the town hall, which is expected to take a year to complete. If he wins this contract, he will need to keep the crane. Once the town hall contract is complete, he will sell the crane. He estimates that he could sell it for $120,000 in one year's time. If he does not win the town hall contract, he will sell the crane immediately for $150,000. For the town hall contract, the relevant cost of the crane is $30,000. This is the fall in the realisable value of the crane if it is used on this contract. 

3.4.2 Deprival Value 
If an asset that is required for a contract is already owned but currently fully utilised in other activities, the relevant cost is its deprival value (i.e. the cost of depriving the business of the asset). Deprival value is determined by consideration of the "value in use" and the "replacement cost" of the asset: Value in use is the value to the business of the asset that is already owned. This is the higher of its net realisable value (i.e. the net amount that would be realised if it was disposed of) and its economic value. Economic value is the present value of the future earnings that the asset would generate for the business. 
Key Point Decision rule: 
· If economic value < net realisable value, the asset should be sold. 
· If economic value > net realisable value, the asset should be kept. 
Replacement cost is the cost of acquiring an equivalent asset (i.e. with the same operating capability). 
Key Point 
Deprival value is the lowest cost option. The business needs to decide whether to: 
· buy an equivalent asset for the contract (i.e. incur the replacement cost); or 
· transfer the asset from existing activities (i.e. forego its value in use). 
The determination of deprival value can be thought of as a two-stage decision: 
· Decision 1-should the asset be kept in use in the business or sold? If an asset is in use, its economic value (EV) should be higher than its net realisable value (NRV). 
· Decision 2-if deprived of the asset (e.g. through sale or use elsewhere), will it be replaced? 

Example of Economic Value v Net Realisable Value 
Some years ago, Hyacinth Co bought a piece of machinery for $300,000. The machine's net book value ("carrying amount" in the financial statements) is currently $50,000. Hyacinth could spend $100,000 on updating the machine, and the products subsequently made on it could generate a contribution of $150,000. The machine would be depreciated at $25,000 per annum. Alternatively, if the machine is not updated, it could be sold now for $80,000 after incurring $5,000 in advertising and other costs to make the sale. Immediately, the $300,000 purchase cost, $50,000 net book value and $25,000 depreciation charge are disregarded as they are not cash flows and are irrelevant. The economic value of retaining the machinery in the business is $50,000, i.e. the sum of cash flows: 
· Machine update cost: $100,000 
· Contribution from products: $150,000 
However, as this is less than its net realisable value of $75,000 ($80,000 - $5,000), the machine should be sold rather than updated. Therefore, if there is a project requiring this machine, the relevant cost of using it will be $75,000 (i.e. the net sale proceeds foregone). 

Example of Non-current Asset Opportunity Cost 
An asset which will be transferred to a new contract, if it is undertaken, has: 
| Replacement cost     | $200,000 |
| Net realisable value | $50,000  |
| Economic value       | $100,000 |
The opportunity cost of the asset is $100,000. This is the benefit foregone.

Quiz: Contract Quote 
Stella is about to tender for a contract which requires two raw materials, steel and tungsten. Five hundred tons of steel and 1,000 tons of tungsten will be required to complete the contract. In addition, 2,000 hours of labour will be needed. Of this, 1,200 hours are in the assembly process and the remainder in the finishing process. Stella will quote a price that allows a 50% mark-up on the relevant cost. The following additional information is available for the resources required: 
|          | In inventory | Original price per ton | Current price per ton | Net realisable value |
| Steel    | 200 tons     | $10                    | $12                   | $8                   |
| Tungsten | 400 tons     | $20                    | $23                   | $15                  |
Steel cannot be used by Stella for any other purpose, but tungsten is used in all the company's manufacturing processes. All labour is paid at $4 per hour, but to complete the contract in time, labour for the finishing process will have to be transferred from other work, which generates contribution at a rate of $3 per hour (after labour costs). There is currently surplus capacity for assembly labour amounting to 1,000 hours for the duration of the contract. Above this, any additional assembly labour will have to be hired on a temporary basis at the rate of $5 per hour. 
Required: Determine the price Stella will quote on the contract.

Tutorial note: The relevant costs of diverting labour from another contributiongenerating process are the labour wages and the contribution forgone. This is because removing labour from the other process loses contribution and generates savings in labour wages, which must be accounted for in the activity the labour is diverted to. Labour cost for spare capacity is usually assumed to be fixed (as the organisation must pay their wages regardless of their productivity), so utilising spare capacity does not incur relevant costs.

3.5 Non-financial Factors 
From a financial point of view, a contract should proceed if the revenue from the contract exceeds its relevant cost. However, management should also consider non-financial factors before making a final decision. Some of the non-financial factors that may be considered are: 
· A contract may be undertaken even if the revenue is not sufficient to cover the relevant costs if there are other reasons why the agreement is desirable. For example: - Undertaking a new type of contract may develop the business's knowledge and experience, which may be useful in obtaining subsequent business. - The contract may enhance the business's reputation (e.g. a contract for a highprofile customer). 
· A profitable contract may be declined if there is a high risk of reputational damage (e.g. if the agreement will harm the environment or involves activities that may be considered unethical). 

4.1 Relevant Costs As discussed earlier, the costs that should be relevant to any decision are relevant costs, which are incremental in nature. Where managers are given an analysis of profits by division, it may be tempting to assume that loss-making divisions should be shut down. However, before such decisions are taken, managers must know which relevant costs would be saved if the division were closed down. In particular, the head office may have allocated fixed costs to the division. These may not be saved if the division is closed down. Non-incremental costs should be ignored in decision-making. 

Quiz: Shut-down Decision 
Rolling Co has four divisions: North, South, East and West. The directors are concerned about the performance of the East and West divisions, which have consistently shown losses for the last three years. The divisional statements of profit or loss for the last year show the following: 
|                                                            | North | South | East   | West  |
|                                                            | $     | $     | $      | $     |
| Sales                                                      | 5,000 | 10,000 | 7,500 | 6,000 |
| Variable costs                                             | 2,500 | 4,000 | 4,000  | 3,000 |
| Contribution                                               | 2,500 | 6,000 | 3,500  | 3,000 |
| Fixed costs                                                | 1,500 | 3,500 | 4,000  | 3,200 |
| Profits/(losses)                                           | 1,000 | 2,500 | (500)  | (200) |

Further analysis of the fixed costs reveals the following: 
|                                                            | $     | $     | $      | $     |
| Directly attributable                                      | 500   | 1,500 | 2,500  | 2,000 |
| Allocated (20% of revenue)                                 | 1,000 | 2,000 | 1,500  | 1,200 |
| Total fixed costs                                          | 1.500 | 3,500 | 4,000  | 3,200 |
Assumed that directly attributable fixed costs would be saved if the division were closed down.

|                                       | East    | West    |
|                                       | $       | $       |
| Lost contribution                     | (3,500) | (3,000) |
| Saved fixed costs (attributable only) | 2,500   | 2,000   |
| Net savings/(losses)                  | (1,000) | (1,000) |
Conclusion Closing each division would lead to a reduction in profits of $1,000 per year. They should not be closed. The two divisions make a positive contribution to the company's overall profits and only show a loss because of the allocation of central fixed costs.

Quiz: Production Line Closure Decision 
Foxglove Co has two production lines, A and B, and its management accounts show the following: 
|                |   A     |     B    |
|                | $m | $m | $m | $m  |
| Revenue        |    | 28 |    | 30  |
| Marginal costs | 12 |    | 20 |     |
| Fixed costs    | 10 |    | 14 |     |
| Total cost     |    | 22 |    | 34  |
| Profit/loss    |    | 6  |    | (4) |
Fixed costs have been apportioned to each production line on the basis of floor space occupied in the factory. Closing down either production line would save 25% of the total fixed costs. 
Require: Determine whether Foxglove should close down either production line. 

Answer:
The incremental cash flows of closing down the production lines are as follows: 
|                                | A    | B    |
|                                |$m    | $m   |
| Revenue lost                   |(28)  | (30) |
| Marginal costs saved           | 12   | 20   |
| Fixed costs saved ($24m × 25%) | 6    | 6    |
| Net cash outflow               | (10) | (4)  |
Therefore, the closure of either production line is not a good idea as the revenue lost exceeds the cost savings. It is the arbitrary apportionment of the fixed costs that is misleading in the management accounts. A more helpful presentation of the figures for decision making would be:
|                | A  | B  | Total |
|                | $m | $m | $m    |
| Revenue        | 28 | 30 | 58    |
| Marginal costs | 12 | 20 | 32    |
| Contribution   | 16 | 10 | 26    |
| Fixed costs    |    |    | 24    |
| Profit/loss    |    |    | 2     |
If either production line were closed down, fixed costs saved are $6 million; however, the contribution lost from the products would be greater ($16 million or $10 million).

4.2 Non-financial Factors 
When making shut down decisions, management should consider non-financial factors as well as whether losses can be reduced. For example: 
· If closing a division would result in redundancies, this could lead to poor morale among remaining employees. 
· The permanent loss of resources and specific skills may mean that it will not be possible to take advantage of future opportunities.
· Shutting down one division may affect demand for products produced by other divisions (e.g. if customers like to buy a range of products from one supplier, closing a particular division will limit the range that is available). 
· It may be possible to bring a loss-making division back to profitability by developing new products or services. · Shutting down a division may make it possible to sell assets such as buildings to raise finance for other divisions or to reduce debt. 

5.1 Joint Products 
Joint products and by-products arise where the manufacture of one product makes the manufacture of other products inevitable. Joint products have significant relative sales value. A by-product is produced with one or more main products but has a small relative sales value. (So it is unlikely to influence the decision to produce main products.) Products produced are not separately identifiable until a particular stage in the production process - the split-off point (SOP). Costs incurred before the SOP are joint or pre-separation costs and must be apportioned between the products produced. 
Once the products have reached the split-off point: 
· It may be possible to sell the product immediately in its current state. 
· The product may require further processing before it can be sold. 
· The manufacturer may have a choice of selling the product immediately or processing it further. 
In making the further processing decision, the manufacturer needs to compare the additional revenue gained by further processing the product against the additional costs of further processing. 

Example of Further Processing Decision 
Two products, G and H, are created from a joint process. G can be sold immediately after split-off. H requires further processing before it is ready for sale as a finished product. If not further processed for sale as a finished product, it can be sold as scrap at $0.30 per unit. The following data is available for the last period: 
|                                      | $       | Product | Selling price per unit |
| Total joint production costs         | 384,000 | G       | $0.84 (400,000 units)  |
| Further processing costs (product H) | 159,600 | H       | $1.82 (200,000 units)  |
The relevant costs and revenues in determining whether H should be processed further are the additional revenue of $304,000 (200,000 x ($1.82 - $0.30) less the costs of further processing of $159,600. Further processing of H increases profits by $144,400, so H should be further processed. The joint production costs incurred before the split-off point are a common cost and therefore not relevant to the further-processing decision. They will be relevant, however, to determining whether the overall process is viable.

Quiz: Further Processing Decision 
Daisy Co buys a chemical for $12,000, which is broken down into two components: 
| Component | Sales value ($) | Allocated costs ($) |
| A         | 7,000           | 6,000               |
| B         | 4,000           | 6,000               |
Component A can be converted into Product A if $6,000 is spent on further processing. Product A would sell for $12,000. Component B can be converted into Product B if $8,000 is spent on further processing. Product B would sell for $15,000. 
Required: Determine the optimal production plan to maximise profits. 

Answer:
As the initial chemical is split into both components, it is not possible to make one component without the other; without any further processing, the breaking down of the chemical into two components is not worthwhile as the cost ($12,000) exceeds $11,000 revenue ($7,000 + $4,000). Further processing Component A into Product A incurs incremental costs of $6,000 and generates incremental revenue of $5,000 ($12,000 - $7,000). This is not worthwhile. Further processing Component B to Product B incurs incremental costs of $8,000 and generates incremental revenues of $11,000 ($15,000 - $4,000). It is worthwhile to do this, as the extra revenue is greater than the additional costs. The optimal production plan is therefore: 
|                                   | $ $    |	  $   |
| Component A revenue               |        | 7,000  |
| Product B revenue                 |        | 15,000 |
| Total revenue                     |        | 22,000 |
| Chemical cost                     | 12,000 |        |
| Further processing of Component B | 8,000  |        |
| Total cost                        |        | 20,000 |
| Contribution                      |        | 2,000  |
|                                   |        |        |
Having determined whether or not to further process products after the split-off point, a decision needs to be made about the financial viability of the overall process. This should consider all revenues, less all relevant costs of further processing (if appropriate) and the main process.

6.1 Outsourcing Outsourcing is buying goods or services externally rather than making or providing them internally. For many years, there has been a trend towards outsourcing non-core services. Examples of services that are often outsourced include: 
· office cleaning; 
· canteen and catering services; 
· payroll services; 
· IT services; 
· security services. 
Outsourcing is not limited to providing services; parts of manufacturing processes also may be outsourced. This trend has been strengthened by the reduced costs of international trade; many components may be made in lower-cost economies, and the assembly of the final products may take place closer to the markets in which the products are sold. The decision companies may have to make, therefore, is whether to make components in-house or to buy them from an external supplier. 

6.2 Advantages of Outsourcing 
· Lower cost. Many companies have discovered that some goods or services may be purchased for less than it would cost to provide them internally. This may be due to the economies of scale enjoyed by the third-party provider. 
· Services may become a variable cost rather than a fixed cost if outsourced. For example, the cost of outsourcing payroll services may be based on the number of personnel. If payroll services were sourced in-house, staff would have to be employed to provide this service (i.e. effectively a fixed or stepped cost). 
· Outsourcing allows management to focus on the core competencies of the business without being distracted by managing peripheral areas. 
· A specialist supplier may be able to supply goods or services of higher quality. 
· Access to a broader range of expertise as the provider deals with several clients. For example, a provider of IT services may have employees with a wider range of skills and knowledge than an internal IT function. 

6.3 Disadvantages of Outsourcing 
· The company relies on a third party to provide a reliable supply. Therefore, it loses control over a part of its business processes. 
· Outsourcing may mean trusting a third party with confidential information about goods or services. 
· Some costs may not be apparent (i.e. hidden) as anything not explicitly covered by the contract will incur additional charges. 
· Quality may suffer, especially if the contract price per unit is fixed (i.e. the third party can only increase its profit by reducing costs). 
· Operational dependence on the outsourcing company is linked to its financial stability. Switching to another provider may be very costly if the third-party company fails. 
· Outsourcing may demotivate the workforce if the decision to outsource is associated with job losses. (There may also be bad publicity where outsourcing is to another country.) 

6.4 Make vs. Buy Decisions 
When deciding whether to outsource the manufacture of a particular component, organisations will obviously want to calculate the financial effect. Although financial impact will not be the only factor to be considered, it will likely be significant. If a company outsources all production of an item, there will be no in-house production. This may lead to some fixed cost savings since less production capacity will be required. The approach here is to determine the costs saved if in-house production ceases, including any incremental fixed costs, and compare this with the costs of buying-in the component from an external supplier. 

Example of Make or Buy-in 
Geranium Co makes a product that requires two sequential operations on the same machine. Operation 1 takes 15 minutes per unit, and Operation 2 takes 30 minutes per unit. The machine is operating at full capacity. The material cost of the product is $12 per unit. Instead of carrying out Operation 1, Geranium could buy in components for $15 per unit. This would increase production capacity because the machine has to deal with only Operation 2. Labour and variable overheads are incurred at a rate of $16 per machine hour, and the finished products sell for $30 per unit. 
Make the entire product internally or buy in components? 
Machine operating costs - the machine is already operating at full capacity and will remain fully utilised, but only on Operation 2. Therefore, machine running costs will not change and so are not relevant to the decision. 
Material - if the buy-in option is accepted, the material cost increases from $12 to $15 per unit. 
Production volume - this can increase by 50% because currently, each item takes 30 minutes in Operation 2, but 15 minutes per unit will be released by Operation 1, which now will not be needed. Assuming output is 1,000 units, say, the incremental cash flows are as follows: 
Increase in revenue (500 additional units * $30) $15,000 
Increase in costs ((1,500 * $15) - (1,000 * $12)) $10,500 
Therefore, it is worth buying in as incremental revenue exceeds incremental costs.

Quiz: Outsourcing All Production 
Big Phones makes smartphones. The company sells 1 million phones each year. Each phone includes a standard rechargeable battery. Currently, the batteries are manufactured in-house, but the company has recently received an offer from Super Batteries to supply all the batteries required for a price of $2 each. The management accountant has prepared a schedule showing the total costs of producing 1 million batteries last year as follows: 
                     | $000 |
Materials 	     |1,400 |
Direct labour 	     | 320  |
Machine running costs| 240  |
Depreciation         | 250  |
Other overheads	     | 400  |
Total		     | 2,610| 
Depreciation includes depreciation of the factory building, which is apportioned to each product. $75,000 has been apportioned to the battery manufacturing department. If the manufacture of batteries were to be outsourced, this part of the factory would remain empty, at least in the short term. Other overheads include a $300,000 apportionment of general factory overheads not specific to making batteries. 
Required: Determine the costs that would be saved if the offer is accepted and advise Big Phones whether it should continue to manufacture the batteries in-house or should outsource their manufacture to Super Batteries.

Answer:
If manufacturing were to stop, the following costs would be saved each year: 
|                                               | $000  |
| Materials                                     | 1,400 |
| Direct labour                                 | 320   |
| Machine running costs                         | 240   |
| Depreciation                                  | NIL   | Note
| Other overheads (400 - 300 general overheads) | 100   | Note
| Total                                         | 2,060 |
Costs of buying 1 million batteries from Super Batteries would be $2 million. 
Advice: The cost of buying from Super Batteries is less than the savings made from stopping the manufacture of the batteries in-house (i.e. it is more expensive to make than to buy). The batteries should therefore be bought from Super Batteries. 
Note: Depreciation is ignored as it is not a relevant cash flow. Apportioned overheads would not be saved, so are not relevant savings. 


Summary:
· In decision making, relevant costs and revenues are those which change as a result of the decision. All other revenues and costs are ignored.
· An opportunity cost is a benefit foregone. Opportunity costs are relevant costs.
· Decision-making scenarios include "one-off contracts" which require the calculation of the relevant cost of performing a contract.
· A relevant cost may be a current (replacement) cost or an opportunity cost (which may be zero).
· The deprival value of a non-current asset is the lower of its replacement cost and value in use. Value in use is the higher of net realisable value and economic value.
· In shut down decisions, costs of the loss-making division that will not be saved are irrelevant to the decision.
· Further processing decisions consider whether further processing of joint- or by-products is worthwhile.
· To buy-in rather than make a product is an outsourcing decision.



Chapter 5: Cost Volume Profit Analysis
This chapter covers the following Learning Outcomes. C. Decision-Making Techniques 2. Cost volume profit analysis a) Explain the nature of CVP analysis. b) Calculate and interpret the breakeven point and margin of safety. c) Calculate the contribution to sales ratio, in single and multi-product situations, and demonstrate an understanding of its use. d) Calculate target profit or revenue in single and multi-product situations, and demonstrate an e) Interpret breakeven charts and profit volume charts and interpret the information contained within each, including multi-product situations. f) Discuss the limitations of CVP analysis for planning and decision making. 

1.1 Objective 
Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) analysis looks primarily at the effects of differing levels of activity on the financial results. It focuses on sales volume because although sales price and variable costs are usually known with a degree of accuracy, in the short-term at least, sales volume is not usually so predictable. 
Contribution - earnings from sales after deducting variable costs. Contribution is computed by deducting variable costs from revenue. If variable costs per unit and selling price per unit are constant, contribution is increased by increasing sales volume. Contribution would also be the funds available to cover fixed costs. If there is insufficient funds to cover fixed costs, the entity would be making a loss. Any excess of contribution over fixed costs is profit. 

1.2 Breakeven Point 
Breakeven point - the level of activity at which neither a profit nor a loss is made.
The breakeven point is a measure of the lowest activity level at which the activity is viable, where: Total contribution = Total fixed costs 

Example of Dependence on Sales Volume 
Company A knows that the sales price for product X for the coming year will be around $50, and its variable costs are approximately $30. The company can therefore say, with some degree of certainty, that the contribution per unit (sales price less variable costs) is $20. Company A also expects to have annual fixed costs of $200,000. Whether Company A will make a profit in the year depends on sales volume. This may be difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. However, it is easy to determine the sales volume that the company needs to achieve in order to make a profit; the breakeven point. In this case, Company A would need to generate $200,000 of contribution to cover the annual fixed costs of $200,000. This would mean that it would need to sell 10,000 ($200,000 / $20 per unit) units of Product X to break even. 
There are three methods for calculating the breakeven point: 
1. A graphical method with charts (s.2) 
2. Using formulae (s.3.2); and 
3. The contribution/sales ratio ("contribution margin") method (s.3.3). 

1.3 Simplifying Assumptions 
All the methods are based on the same simplifying assumptions as follows: 
· Within the range of activity under consideration, total cost behaves as a strictly linear semi-variable cost: - fixed costs remain fixed within the range; - total variable costs change proportionally with volume. 
· Unit selling prices do not change with volume. 
· Costs and income are matched (i.e. there is no significant change in inventory). 
· Levels of efficiency and productivity do not change (as this would affect linearity). 
· There is only a single product or a constant sales mix of more than one product. 

Key Point 
Total costs and total revenue are linear functions of output. 

2.1 Breakeven Chart 
The breakeven chart plots revenue and costs ($) against volume (units). The point where the total cost and revenue lines intersect is the breakeven point (BEP). 
You will not be required to draw breakeven charts or any other diagrams in the exam. However, you need to understand their construction to interpret them.

Quiz: Breakeven Chart  
A company makes one product, the gamma. The selling price per unit is $100. The variable cost per unit is $20. Fixed costs per year are $1,000,000. 
Required: Draw a breakeven chart for the gamma and determine from the chart how many units must be sold per year to break even. 

Answer: 
From the diagram below, it can be seen that the breakeven level of sales is 12,500 units. 
(Draw a breakeven chart for gamma) 
To plot each line, it is necessary to calculate total cost or total revenue at only two levels of output: 
Total revenue
When output is 0, total revenue is zero. An output level of 15,000 units was chosen at random. At an output level of 15,000 units, total revenue would be $1.5 million ($100 per unit * 15,000 units). 
Total costs
When output = 0, total costs = fixed costs, = $1 million. 
At an output level of 15,000 units (chosen at random), total variable costs are $300,000 ($20 per unit * 15,000). Fixed costs are $1 million. 
Therefore, total costs are $1,300,000. 
------

2.2 Profit-Volume Chart 
A "PV" chart is another way of presenting the same information as a breakeven chart, but it emphasises profits and losses at different activity levels (i.e. sales volume or value). To construct it requires only the following information: 
· Profit/(loss) at any (i.e. just one) level of sales; and 
· Total fixed costs (i.e. total loss at zero sales volume). 

3.1 Contribution 
In the short term, the fixed costs of a business do not change with output. Therefore, producing/selling one extra unit results in: 
· Extra revenue (the unit selling price). 
· Extra costs (the variable cost per unit). 
The additional profit made from selling one extra unit is the unit contribution. 
Unit contribution = Selling price - Variable cost per unit 
Total contribution = Total revenue - Total variable cost 
In any decision connected with varying the levels of production, fixed costs are not relevant as they do not change regardless of which course of action is taken. 

Key Point 
It is only the change in contribution which will affect the decision. 

3.2 Breakeven Formulae 
A little basic arithmetic can help answer different CVP questions. 

3.2.1 What is the BEP? 
Profit = Sales - Variable cost - Total fixed cost Profit 
Profit = Total contribution - Total fixed cost 
At BEP, profit = 0 Therefore, Total contribution = Fixed cost 
But, Total contribution = Number of units * Unit contribution 
Therefore, Number of units to be sold to breakeven = Unit contribution Total fixed cost 

3.2.2 How to Achieve Target Profits? 
Management will typically want to budget for a sales volume or sales revenue to achieve a target profit: 
Sales volume to achieve a target profit = (Total fixed cost + required profit)/Unit contribution  
Sales revenue to achieve a target profit = Sales volume to achieve a target profit * unit selling price 

3.2.3 What is the Breakeven Revenue? 
· BEP is expressed in terms of the number of units which must be sold to break even. 
· Breakeven revenue is the revenue achieved at the BEP. One way of calculating this is to multiply the number of units at BEP by the unit selling price. 

Quiz: Using the Formulae Hide Using the information in Activity 1, calculate: 
a. the breakeven point for the gamma using the numerical approach; 
b. the sales volume required to make a profit of $100,000; 
c. the revenue at the breakeven point. 

Answer:
a. BEP = Total Fixed cost/Unit contribution = 1,000,000/($100-$20 = 12,500 units 
b. Sales volume required to make a profit to $100,000 = (Fixed cost + Required profit)/Unit contribution = (1,000,000+$100,000)/$80 = 13,750 units 
c. Revenue at BEP = $100 * 12,500 units = $1,250,000. 
------

3.3 Contribution/Sales (C/S) Ratio 
3.3.1 C/S Ratio 
The contribution/sales ratio (also called contribution margin) is the proportion of the selling price which contributes to fixed overheads and profits. 
C/S ratio = Contribution per unit/Selling per unit or Total contribution/Total Sales revenue 

3.3.2 Breakeven Revenue 
The C/S ratio can be used as an alternative way of calculating breakeven revenue without first calculating the breakeven point. 
Breakeven revenue = Fixed cost/ C/S ratio 
Revenue required to achieve a target profit = (Fixed cost + required profit)/ C/S ratio 

3.4 Margin of Safety 
Margin of safety - the amount by which anticipated or existing activity exceeds (or falls short of) breakeven. 
In units or in dollars$: Margin of safety = Budgeted sales - Breakeven sales)
As a percentage: (Budgeted sales-Breakeven sales)/Budgeted sales * 100%

Quiz: Target Revenue 
A company manufactures a single product which has the following cost structure based on a production budget of 10,000 units. 
|                                                                     | $       |
| Materials  - 4 kg at $3/kg                                          | 12      |
| Direct Labour - 5 hours at $7/hr                                    | 35      |
Variable production overheads are recovered at the rate of $8 per direct labour hour. Other costs incurred by the company are:

4.1 Assumption 
CVP analysis can be extended to multi-product situations if a constant pre-determined sales mix is applied. If the assumption of a standard mix is relaxed, there will be no unique BEP. 

4.2 Calculation of Breakeven Point 
4.2.1 Weighted Average C/S Ratio The easiest way to calculate breakeven revenue in multi-product situations is to apply a C/S ratio (as in s.3.3). The only difference is that the C/S ratio will be weighted: 
Weighted average C/S ratio = Total contribution (from all products)/Total revenue (from all products) 
The C/S ratio now specifies how much contribution will be generated by a $1 increase in sales revenue earned in the constant sales mix. It is used to find: 
· breakeven revenue; and 
· sales revenue required to generate a target profit. 
Apply the same formulae used in single-product situations but with the weighted C/S ratio: 
Breakeven revenue = Fixed cost/Weight averge C/S ratio 
Revenue required to achieve a target profit = (Fixed cost + required profit)/Weighted average C/S ratio 

Example of Multi-product Analysis 
Company A produces Product X and Y. The information for both products is as follows: 
|                        | X            | Y         |Company A    |
| Sales price ($/unit)   | 50           | 60.       |		  |
| Variable cost ($/unit) | 30           | 45        |             |
| Contribution ($/unit)  | 20           | 15        |             |
| Budgeted sales (units) | 20,000       | 10,000    |             |
| Total contribution ($) | 400,000      | 150,000   | 550,000     |
| Total sales ($)        | 1,000,000    | 600,000   | 1,600,000   |
| C/S ratio              | 0.4          | 0.25      | 0.34375     |
The weighted average C/S ratio of 0.34375 or 34.375% is simply the total contribution of X and Y divided by the total revenue of X and Y. It represents the contribution towards fixed costs on each $ of revenue when X and Y are sold in the constant mix that is two units of X for every unit of Y. 
BEP in sales revenue = Fixed costs/C/S ratio = $200,000/0.34375 = $581,819 sales revenue 
To achieve a target profit of $300,000 = (Fixed costs + required profit)/C/S ratio = ($200,000 + $300,000)/0.34375 =$1,454,546 
Remember that when dealing with budgeted amounts, accuracy to the nearest $ is not particularly meaningful, and these amounts might be reported to management to the nearest $000 or even $m to 2 decimal places (e.g. $0.58 and $1.45 million). 
Also, these are only estimates because of the constant mix assumption.
Exam advice: Weighted average C/S ratio must be used for calculations in multi-product situations. 

Quiz: Multi-Product Analysis 
Pear manufactures laptop computers and smartphones. The company has prepared the following forecast for the next financial period: 
|                    | Laptops | Smartphones |
| Budget sales       | 1,200   | 600         |
|                    | $       | $           |
| Unit selling price | 1,000   | 500         |
| Unit variable cost | 700     | 400         |
| Unit contribution  | 300     | 100         |
Budget fixed costs are $245,000 for the period. 
Required: 
a. The breakeven revenue, using the weighted average C/S ratio. 
b. The sales revenue required to make a target profit of $245,000. 

Answer:
The weighted average C/S ratio = Total (budgeted) contribution/Total (budgeted) sales 
Total budgeted contribution is (1,200 * 300) + (600 * 100) = $420,000 
Total budgeted revenue is (1,200 * 1,000) + (600 * 500) = $1,500,000 
Weighted average C/S ratio is therefore 420,000 /1,500,000 = 0.28 
a. Breakeven revenue = Fixed cost/ Weighted average C/S ratio = 245,000/0.28 = $875,000. 
b. Sales revenue to make a profit of $245,000  = (Fixed cost + Required profit)/Weighted average C/S ratio = (245,000+245,000)/0.28 = $1,750,000 

4.2.2 Sales Units at Breakeven Revenue 
In multi-product situations, breakeven revenue shows the total revenue required to break even, assuming the budgeted sales mix. Decision makers may wish to analyse this revenue by product. This can be estimated by multiplying the total breakeven revenue by the revenue ratio for each product (i.e. the portion of total revenue that each product earns): 
Revenue ratio for product X = Budgeted revenue for product X/Total budgeted revenue   
At breakeven: 
Revenue from product X = Total breakeven revenue * Revenue ratio for product X. 

4.3 Multi-Product Profit-Volume (PV) Charts 
In a multi-product environment, sales revenue is drawn on the horizontal axis (x axis) and profit is drawn on the vertical axis (y axis). Two approaches are taken to drawing the line denoting profit/loss: 
· constant (fixed) sales mix; or 
· ranking of products by profitability. 

4.3.1 Assuming a Constant Sales Mix Assuming a constant mix of products based on the budgeted sales, it is only necessary to know the profit for two values of sales (to plot on the graph and draw a straight line between them): 
· The most straightforward point is where revenue = 0 (i.e. where the company makes a loss equal to fixed costs). 
· For the second point it makes most sense to calculate profit for total budgeted sales. 

Example of Multi-Product Profit-Volume Chart 
Zed Co makes two products, Exe and Wye. Details of these two products are as follows: 
|                        | Exe    | Wye    |
| Selling price ($/unit) | 40     | 60     |
| Contribution ($/unit)  | 24     | 18     |
| Budgeted sales (units) | 10,000 | 10,000 |
Total fixed costs are budgeted at $100,000 
When sales revenue = 0, loss = $100,000 (fixed costs) 
At total budgeted sales: 
Revenue = (10,000 * 40) + (10,000 * 60) = $1,000,000. 
Profit = Contribution - Fixed cost = (10,000 * 24) + (10,000 * 18) - 100,000 = 320,000. 
(plot the The profit-volume chart)
Where revenue is zero, the cumulative profit will be a loss that equates to total fixed costs. The breakeven point occurs where the line crosses the x axis, at the point where revenue = $238,000. It is unlikely that the BEP would be determined so accurately from the graph alone, but the breakeven revenue could be checked using the formula. 

4.3.2 Assuming Sales by "Profitability" 
An alternative assumption is that sales are not made in a standard sales mix but by prioritising the most profitable products (i.e. the company produces and sells the product with the highest contribution first). Products are, therefore, ranked according to their C/S ratios. In this case, the PV chart will no longer be a straight line; it will be "kinked". However, a graph can be constructed from a table of profits calculated at the following points: 
1. Sales revenue = 0 
2. Maximum sales of the most profitable product, with no sales of the second product. 
3. Maximum sales of the first and second products. 
4. Maximum sales of the first, second and third products (if there are three products). 
And so on. 

Example of Sales by "Profitability" 
Assuming now that Zed Co decides to produce and sell the product that has the highest C/S ratio up to the maximum budgeted (10,000 units), followed by the other product (again up to maximum 10,000 units). 
|                        | Exe | Wye |
| Selling price ($/unit) | 40  | 60  |
| Contribution ($/unit)  | 24  | 18  |
| C/S ratio              | 0.6 | 0.3 |
| Ranking                | 1st | 2nd |
The cumulative profit/(loss) corresponding to cumulative revenue is calculated as follows: 
| Sales volume | Contribution | Cumulative profit/loss | Revenue | Cumulative revenue |
| 0            | 0            | (100,000)              | 0       | 0                  |
| Exe 10,000   | 240,000      | 140,000                | 400,000 | 400,000            |
| Wye 10,000   | 180,000      | 320,000                | 600,000 | 1,000,000          |
The line joining these three points gives the profit-volume chart: 
(draw the profit-volume chart)
Analysis
Up to revenue of $400,000, the company is selling only Exe. After this it starts to sell Wye. Since Wye generates contribution at a lower rate per $ of revenue than Exe, the line is flatter after this point. The breakeven point is where the line crosses the x axis, at the point where sales = $166,000. This is lower than the breakeven point, assuming a constant sales mix. This is because the C/S ratio of product Exe is higher than the weighted average C/S ratio of the two products together.

Quiz: Multi-Product Breakeven Charts 
Plum manufactures two types of car; the "boy racer" and the "family saloon". The following budgeted daily information has been prepared: 
|                      | Boy racer | Family saloon |
| Budget sales (units) |           |               |
|                      | 300       | 600           |

| Unit contribution    | 5,000     | 3,000         |
Budgeted fixed costs are $1 million per day

Required: Assuming that the budgeted sales represents maximum sales of each of the two products, construct the PV chart for the two products based on the assumption that: 
a. sales occur in the standard (budgeted) mix; and 
b. sales of the most profitable product occur first, followed by sales of the second product. 

Answer:
a. Assuming that sales occur in the budgeted sales mix
 When sales = 0, loss = $1,000,000 (fixed costs). 
For budgeted sales: Revenue = (300 * 10,000) + (600 * 15,000) = $12,000,000 
Profit = Contribution - Fixed costs = (300 * 5,000) + (600 * 3,000)- 1,000,000 = $2,300,000
b. Assuming that most profitable products are sold first 
The C/S ratio of the boy racer is higher, 50%, compared to 20% for family saloons. Therefore, boy racer would be produced first. 
Revenue and profits at the key points are as follows: The amounts are as follows: 
|                             | Contribution | Cumulative Profit/loss | Revenue | Cumulative Revenue |
| $000                        | $000         | $000                   | $000    |
| Sales revenue = 0           | 0            | (1,000)                | 0       | 0                  |
| Max sales of boy racers     | 1,500        | 500                    | 3,000   | 3,000              |
| Max sales of family saloons | 1,800        | 2,300                  | 9,000   | 12,000             |

5.1 Simplifying Assumptions 
The main limitations of CVP analysis for planning and decision making relate to the assumptions that must be made. In summary, these are: 
· Fixed costs remain constant regardless of the production decision. In practice, fixed costs may not be truly fixed and may vary as output changes. For example, fixed costs might be stepped in behaviour as production volume increases. 
· Variable cost per unit is constant (which may not be the case due to discounts and other economies of scale). 
· Selling price remains constant. This may not be true in practice, where an increase in sales volume can only be achieved by lowering the price. 

5.2 Multi-Product Situations 
5.2.1 Product Mix 
Assuming a fixed product mix is necessary to work with multi-product situations. If the product mix is allowed to vary, there could be many breakeven points. In practice, a company would want to know how varying its product mix would affect profits. 

5.2.2 PV Charts Advantages: 
· Multi-product PV charts enable the user to see easily the relationship between revenue and profit. Breakeven revenue can also be seen. 
· Identifying the most and least profitable products should lead to improved decisionmaking. 
Disadvantages: 
· The PV chart assumes either a constant sales mix or assumes that products are sold in order of increasing C/S ratio. The actual sales mix is likely to deviate from these assumptions, making the conclusions about breakeven revenue incorrect. 
· The chart shows only profits plotted against revenue. It does not show variable costs or output in units. 
· The chart assumes that products can be sold in order of profitability, which ignores the possibility that sales of one product may depend on sales of another. 

Summary:
· The breakeven point is the level of activity at which a company makes neither profit nor loss. To break even, a business needs to sell enough units to cover its fixed and variable costs.
· A breakeven chart shows how total costs and revenues vary with output. The profit-volume chart shows how profit varies with output.
· The following formulae are all easily derived and are not provided in the exam:
      Breakeven point = ​Total fixed cost/Unit contribution​
      C/S ratio = ​Contribution per unit/Selling price per unit​
      Breakeven revenue = ​Fixed cost/ C/S ratio​
· In multi-product situations, a standard or per-determined product mix must be assumed to remain constant. Breakeven revenue can be calculated by dividing fixed costs by a weighted average C/S ratio.
· The usefulness of CVP analysis is limited by the simplifying assumptions that have to be made to make it work.



Chapter 6: Limiting Factor Decisions
This chapter covers the following Learning Outcomes. C. Decision-Making Techniques 3. Limiting factors a) Identify limiting factors in a scarce resource situation and select an appropriate technique. b) Determine the optimal production plan where an organisation is restricted by a single limiting factor, including within the context of "make" or "buy" decisions. c) Formulate and solve multiple scarce resource problems using both linear programming graphs and using simultaneous equations as appropriate. d) Explain and calculate shadow prices (dual prices) and discuss their implications on decision making and performance management. e) Calculate slack and explain the implications of the existence of slack for decision making and performance management. (Excluding simplex and sensitivity to changes in objective functions.)

1.1 Limiting Factor Analysis (Key Factor Analysis) 
In the short term, sales demand may be greater than productive capacity. For example, output may be restricted by a shortage of: 
· labour; · materials; 
· machinery; or 
· factory space. 
Where such limiting factors apply, contribution (and therefore profit) is maximised by using scarce resources on the product(s) which make the "best use" of them. It is important to note that the final limiting factor is always maximum sales demand. 

1.2 One Limiting Factor 
Rule: Where resources are unlimited - make all those products which give "positive contribution" up to maximum demand. 
Rule: Where a factor of production is limited - contribution and profit will be maximised by concentrating production on the product(s) which make(s) "best use" of the scarce resource, up to maximum demand. 

1.2.1 Approach 
The following approach is used to decide which product(s) to make to maximise contribution and, therefore, profit where one of the factors of production is limited: 
1. Identify the limiting factor. To find this, calculate how many units of each resource are required to produce sufficient quantities of each product to meet maximum demand. A resource is a limiting factor if it has insufficient availability to meet maximum demand. 
Example of Limiting Factor Identification 
Company A uses two materials in production, Material J and Material K. Material J is restricted to 12,000 kg, while Material K is restricted to 24,000 kg. The demand and material use for Products A, B, and C are shown in the table below. 
| Product          | A    | B    | C    |
| Kg of K per unit | 4    | 1    | 6    |
| Kg of J per unit | 4    | 2    | 8    |
| Maximum Demand   | 3000 | 4000 | 1000 |
Given the above data, the total kg of Material K demanded to meet maximum demand is 22,000 kg, which is less than the available material K of 24,000 kg. The total kg of Material J demand to meet maximum demand is 28,000 kg, which is more than the 12,000 kg of Material J available. Material J is the limiting factor. 

2. Calculate the contribution per unit of each product. 
3. Calculate contribution per unit of limiting factor for each product: 
Contribution per unit/Units of scarce resource used 
4. Rank the products according to the contribution per unit of limiting factor, with products with the largest contribution per limiting factor ranked first; and 
5. Concentrate production on those products with the highest contribution per unit of limiting factor - until all the scarce resource is used up, or maximum demand is fulfilled, whichever is first.

| Kg of R per unit           | 4  | 2  | 8  |

Required: Calculate the maximum contribution that can be achieved.

Answer: 
| Product               | H   | I   | J     |
| Contribution per unit | $16 | $10 | $24   |
| Kg of R per unit      | 4   | 2   | 8     |
| Contribution per kg   | $4  | $5  | $3    |
| Rank                  | 2   | 1   | 3     |
As there is no demand limitation (the firm can sell all products made), the product with the highest contribution should be made (Product I) 
Therefore produce 12,000/2 = 6,000 units of I

Suppose that sales of Product I are restricted to 4,000 units. 
Required: Calculate the maximum contribution that can be achieved.

Answer:
The product with the highest contribution per limiting factor (Product I) should be made first up to maximum demand, then the product with the second highest contribution per limiting factor (Product H), until the limiting factor is used up. 
|                                      | Kg     |

1.2.2 Limitations of Key Factor Analysis 
Limitations of the key factor analysis approach to decision making include the following: 
· It assumes a single objective of contribution/profit maximisation. 
· It assumes constant variable cost per unit and constant total fixed costs; this may only hold over a narrow range of activity (e.g. discounts may apply to materials or sales for larger quantities). 
· It deals with only one scarce resource; if there is more than one, linear programming must be used (s.3.1). 
· It applies only to situations where capacity constraints cannot be removed in the short term. 

1.3 Shadow Price 
The shadow price (or dual price) is a term which is applied to limited resources. 
Shadow price - the additional contribution that would be generated if one more unit of the scarce resource were to become available. The significance of the shadow price is that companies may be able to obtain additional quantities of a scarce resource if they are prepared to pay a higher price. The shadow price represents the maximum premium over the normal price the company would be prepared to pay for each additional unit. The maximum price for an additional unit of the scarce resource is the sum of the regular price and shadow price. Paying prices higher than this will result in lower contribution, as the cost of an additional unit of the scarce resource would be higher than the additional contribution earned from it. 

1.4 Throughput Accounting 
Throughput accounting was detailed in Chapter 3. It is worth noting that limiting factor analysis may also be used with throughput contribution if the objective is to maximise throughput. Usually, the limiting factor is the amount of time available on the bottleneck resource. The following approach is used: 1. Calculate the throughput per unit generated by each product. Throughput per unit is sales price less direct materials cost. 2. Calculate the throughput return per hour of bottleneck resource for each product. (See Example 5 in Chapter 3.) This is calculated as: Throughput per unit Bottleneck hour required to produce one unit 3. Rank the products based on the return per hour of bottleneck resource (from highest to lowest). 

2.1 Decisions with a Limiting Factor 
Chapter 4 introduced outsourcing and "make v buy" decisions that consider producing or buying all of a particular product or component. This section deals with situations in which only some production will be outsourced due to a limiting factor that prevents the business from producing all that is needed. The limiting factor could be a scarce material, a particular type of skilled labour or any other resource. The following assumptions apply: 
· The business makes several products that use the limiting factor. 
· The cost of making items in-house is less than that of outsourcing. 
· Due to the limiting factor, it is not possible to produce the required quantities of all products. Some production needs to be outsourced. 
Assuming that the company can decide which components to make in-house and which to outsource, it should: 
. make those components or products where the biggest savings can be made; and 
· outsource the remainder. 
Method: To decide which products should be made and which should be bought, calculate the saving per unit of scarce resource from making the product rather than from buying it: 
Saving per unit of scarce resource = (Buy-in price - Variable cost to make)/Number of units of scarce resource used per unit   
The products with the greatest saving per unit of scarce resource should be given the highest priority for manufacture.

| Product/Component                  | X         | Y     | Z     |
| Units required each month          | 2,000     | 2,500 | 4,000 |
| Variable cost to make ($ per unit) | 10        | 12    | 14    |
| Buy-in price ($ per unit)          | 13        | 17    | 16    |
| Number of kg of B used per unit    | 3         | 2     | 1     |
Required: Determine which products/components the company should make and which it should buy. 

Answer:
| Savings per unit of scarce resource | X             | Y             | Z           |
| 13-10 3 = 1                         | 17-12 2 = 2.5 | 16-14 1 = 2   |
| Ranking                             | 3             | 1             | 2           |
Comment: Therefore, the company should initially make Ys and then make as many Zs as possible. 

Utilisation of B 
|                           | Kg of B |
| 2,500 Ys x 2 kg each uses | 5,000   |
| 3,000 Zs x 1 kg each uses | 3,000   |
| Total B overall           | 8,000   |
Comment: The additional 1,000 Zs and 2,000 Xs required should be bought.

2.2 Shadow Prices in Make v Buy 
Shadow prices may also be relevant in a make v buy situation where: 
· internal production is limited due to the shortage of a particular factor; and 
· production of some items is being outsourced. 
If additional units of a factor become available, more production can be brought in-house, leading to greater savings.
 
Key Point 
The shadow price in this case is the savings per unit of scarce resource. 

3.1 Linear Programming 
In situations where more than one factor is limited, an alternative approach is used to determine the optimal production so as to maximise contribution (and, therefore, profit). This technique is linear programming: 
· A mathematical technique for problems of rationing scarce resources between products to achieve optimum benefit. 
· Objective function - quantifies the objective. For example: - profit maximisation (which is always by maximising contribution); - cost minimisation. 
· Based on the assumption that the objective and the constraints may be expressed as linear equations. 
· The syllabus only includes situations involving two variables. This allows the equations to be shown as straight lines on a graph. 
· The graph can be used to identify the optimal solution. 
· The optimal solution must be solved algebraically (e.g. using simultaneous equations). 
You will not be required to draw graphs or any other diagrams in the exam. However, you need understand how the optimal solution is derived in order to interpret or solve a given graph. 

3.2 The Graph 
The process of graphing a linear programming model includes the following steps: 
Step 1 Define unknowns. For example, x = Number of units of output of one of the products and y = Number of units of output of the other product. 
Step 2 Formulate the objective function, either to maximise contribution or to minimise cost. Remember to use contribution, not profit. 
Step 3 Express constraints in terms of inequalities (including non-negativity). Constraints (limiting factors) may include resource constraints, production constraints and/or levels of demand. 
Step 4 Plot all constraints on a graph and identify the feasible region. 
Having drawn the graph, the optimal solution can be solved using one of two methods: 
1. The objective function method - also referred to as the iso-contribution method (see s.3.4). This enables the solution to be read from the graph (if the graph is drawn accurately). 
2. The simultaneous equation method (see s.3.5). 

3.3 Problem Formulation 
Example of Linear Programming 
A company makes two products, cabinets and chests. Each product passes through two departments, carpentry and polishing. The time spent in each department is as follows: 
           | Departmental time (hours)|  
|          | Carpentry  | Polishing  |
| Cabinets | 3          | 2          |
| Chests   | 4          | 6          |
There are 4,800 hours available for carpentry, and 5,000 hours available for polishing. Annual production of cabinets must not exceed 1,200 units. Apart from this, all items produced can be sold The contribution to profit and fixed overheads is $100 for a cabinet and $150 for a chest. 
Required: Calculate the optimal product mix which will maximise the total contribution to profit. 

Answer:
Step 1 - Define unknowns 
Let: x = Number of cabinets to be produced per annum; y = Number of chests to be produced per annum; C = Total contribution to profit 
Step 2 - Formulate the objective function 
The function to be maximised is the total contribution to profit (i.e. C). Since cabinets and chests contribute $100 and $150 respectively, for each item produced: 
C = 100x + 150y 
Step 3 - Formulate constraints 
· 4,800 carpentry hours are available to provide 3 hours per cabinet and 4 hours per chest: 3x + 4y ≤ 4,800 
· 5,000 polishing hours are available to provide 2 hours per cabinet and 6 hours per chest: 2x + 6y ≤ 5,000 
· Production of cabinets must not exceed 1,200 units: x ≤ 1,200 
· Because production cannot be negative: x≥ 0, y ≥ 0 
Summary The model is therefore: Maximise C = 100x + 150y 
Subject to: 3x + 4y ≤ 4,800; 2x + 6y ≤5,000; x ≤ 1,200; x, y ≥ 0 
Step 4 - Present graphically 
Plotting lines on a graph 
1. Find the point where each line crosses the y axis, by setting the value of x to 0. 
2. Find the point where each line crosses the x axis by setting the value of y to 0. 
3. Draw a straight line between each of the points. 
For carpentry hours: 
If x = 0, 4y = 4,800 i.e. y = 1,200 
If y = 0, 3x = 4,800 i.e. x = 1,600 
For polishing hours: 
If x = 0, 6y = 5,000 i.e. y = 833.33 
If y = 0, 2x = 5,000 i.e. x = 2,500 
Feasible region 
With the given constraints, all possible values for x and y lie in the boxed area of the graph 0ABCD, called the relevant or feasible region. The point on the boundary of this area must now be found where the contribution (C) has a maximum value. 
Step 5 -The objective function Only one contribution line needs to be plotted to identify the optimal solution. For example, 100x + 150y = 150,000 The highest possible value of C lies where an iso-contribution line is furthest from the origin on the edge of the feasible region. 
Step 6 - Solve the intersection of the two lines: 3x + 4y = 4,800 (1) and 2x + 6y = 5,000 (2) 
Solving simultaneously: 1.5 × (2) ->  3x + 9y = 7,500 (new equation 3)); 3x + 4y = 4,800 (original equation (1))
(3) - (1) -> 5y = 2,700; Therefore y = 540 
Substitute for y in (1): 3x + 2,160 = 4,800; 3x = 2,640 
Therefore x = 880 
Step 7 - Optimal solution 
The optimal solution is to produce 880 cabinets and 540 chests. 
This will give a contribution of C = 100x + 150y =($100 * 880)+($150 * 540)=$169,000 
------

3.4 Objective Function Method 
3.4.1 Iso-contribution Lines 
The objective function shows how contribution varies with product output.  
A contribution line shows all combinations of x and y that would produce a value of contribution. The contribution line is best computed using a value of C that can be divided by the coefficients of both variables x and y. For example, a value of 15,000 is determined for C (15,000 is divisible by both 100 and 150), and some of the values on the line C = 15,000 would be as follows: 
X   | y  |C 
150 |0   |15,000 
90  |40  |15,000
60  |60  |15,000
0   |100 |15,000 

Key Point
You must understand where the values in the table came from. For example, if y = 60, the contribution from y is $9,000 (60 * 150). Contribution from x must, therefore, be $6,000 to achieve a total contribution of $15,000. Since each unit of x generates a contribution of $100, 60 units of x must be sold. 

iso-contribution lines - every point on each line gives the same contribution value).
Two important principles can be deduced from the above: 
· Contribution lines with a higher contribution value are further from the origin (the point x = 0, y = 0) than those with a lower value. 
· All iso-contribution lines are parallel to each other. Just as the iso-contribution line C = 18,000 is parallel to the iso-contribution line C = 15,000, all other possible contribution lines would be parallel to this. (This is because the gradient, or slope, of each line is fixed by the relative amounts of contribution for the two products.) 

3.4.2 Contribution and the Feasible Region 
The diagram below shows a feasible region represented by the area 0ABCD with three iso-contribution lines: 
(draw a diagram that shows a feasible region represented by the area 0ABCD with three iso-contribution lines)
The line furthest from the origin is outside of the feasible region. This means that this level of contribution could not be achieved. Most of the middle contribution line lies outside the feasible region, but there is one point, B, that is on the boundary of the feasible region. Point B represents the combination of production that is feasible at which contribution is maximised. It is the last point within the boundary that is passed by the contribution line before it leaves the boundary. 

3.4.3 Slope of the Contribution Line 
In the previous diagram, point B represented the maximum contribution point. However, had the contribution line been "flatter", point A could be the point of maximum contribution. 
The reason for drawing an iso-contribution line is to identify which point (A, B, C, or D) represents the maximum contribution. 

3.5 Simultaneous Equations Method 
After plotting the feasible region, it is possible to identify the point of maximum contribution without using the objective function method by calculating the contribution at each possible maximum point. 
In the diagram below, the point of maximum contribution must be represented by one of the corner points A, B, C or D or a line between them (e.g. if A and B have the same contribution, all points on the line between them must have the same contribution. 
(draw the diagram)
The procedure is as follows: 1. Determine the value of x and y at each point of intersection, including the points on the x and y axes (where y = 0 and x = 0, respectively) that represent non-negativity constraints. Use simultaneous equations for points where two constraints intersect. 2. Calculate the contribution at each point of intersection by substituting the values of x and y into the contribution function. 3. Compare the values of C at each point. Select the point that corresponds to the highest value of C. 
As the simultaneous equations method is more time consuming than the objective function method, you should not use it unless an exam question explicitly asks for it.

Quiz: Linear Programming 
A manufacturer produces two types of garden furniture - tables and benches. Both use the same material and are produced by the same workforce, which consists of skilled and unskilled workers. The managing director is trying to decide on the optimal production plan to maximise contribution each week. The following standard cost cards apply: 
|                             | Table | Bench |
|                             | $     | $     |
| Material ($5/kg)            | 15    | 10    |
| Skilled labour ($10/hour)   | 50    | 20    |
| Unskilled labour ($4/hour)  | 16    | 4     |
| Variable overhead ($2/hour) | 18    | 6     |
| Total variable cost         | 99    | 40    |
| Selling price               | 134   | 50    |
| Contribution per unit       | 35    | 10    |
There is a shortage of the required material; only 120 kg are available weekly. There are four skilled workers, each working a 35-hour week. 100 hours of part-time unskilled labour are available per week. 
Required: 
a. Formulate this scarce resource problem as a linear programming model. 
b. Determine how many units of each type of furniture should be produced each week to maximise contribution. Calculate the maximum weekly contribution. 

Answer:
a. Formulating the model 
Let x be the number of tables made per week. Let y be the number of benches made per week. The objective function to maximise contribution (C), given by 35x + 10y Subject to constraints: 
| Materials        | 3x + 2y ≤ 120 |
| Skilled labour   | 5x + 2y ≤ 140 |
| Unskilled labour | 4x + y ≤ 100  |
| Non-negative     | x, y ≥ 0      |

b. Determining the optimal solution 
The optimum point is at the intersection of the skilled and unskilled constraints. 
Solving simultaneously: 5x + 2y = 140 (1); 4x + y = (2); 8x + 2y 200 (3); 2 × (2) ->  8x + 2y = 200 (3)
(3) - (1)  -> 3x = 60;  = x = 20 
By substitution in (2) 
80 + y = 100
So to maximise contribution, the company should make and sell 20 of each type of unit. 
Contribution = (20 * $35) + (20 * $10) = $900 
Exam advice Identifying the optimum point using the contribution function means that, at most, only one pair of equations will need to be solved simultaneously. This is likely to be a more efficient use of exam time than also calculating contribution at point A ($600), point B ($800 by solving simultaneously the materials and skilled labour constraints) and point D ($875).

3.6 Assumptions 
The following assumptions give rise to limitations using the graphical method: 
· Linearity - contribution and resource utilisation per unit are the same for any quantity produced and sold in the range under consideration. 
· Infinite divisibility - of products and resources. The solution may not have integer values (e.g. 12 1/4 units of x and 9 3/4 units of y) and should not be rounded. For example, for an optimisation problem: - rounding up will be to a point outside the feasible region; - if rounding down, it will depend on the gradient of the objective function, which integer value lies furthest from the origin. 
· Solution is dependent on the quality of the input data. It must be complete, accurate and valid. 
· Only one quantifiable objective can be satisfied. Non-quantifiable objectives are not considered at all. 
· Single value estimates (e.g. expected values) can be used for uncertain variables. 
· Only two "products" for graphical solution (but see s.4.3). 

4.1 Shadow Price 
Shadow prices (see s.1.3) can also be calculated in linear programming situations. To calculate the shadow price of a particular factor: 1. Restate the constraint for that factor with the number of units available increased by 1. 2. Recalculate the solution to the linear program. For such a small change, it is reasonable to assume that the same point on the graph would be the point of maximum contribution. However, since the equation for the line has changed (increase of 1), it is necessary to recalculate the value of x and y at that point using simultaneous equations. 3. Calculate the revised value of contribution. 4. Deduct the original value of contribution from the revised value. The increase in contribution is the shadow price of the limiting factor. 

4.2 Slack 
4.2.1 Non-binding and Binding Constraints 
In linear programming problems involving several constraints, it is possible that not all constraints are binding at the optimal point (i.e. at the level of production which maximises contribution, not all of the available supply of one or more of the inputs is used). 
Slack - the difference between maximum resources available and resources used at the optimal point. For binding constraints, the value of slack is zero. Slack can be calculated for each resource as the maximum amount available for use less the amount used at the optimal point. It can be calculated by rearranging the equations for each constraint and then substituting the values of x and y at the maximum point. Demand can also be a slack variable if there is unfulfilled demand for a particular product at the point of optimal contribution. 

4.2.2 Implications of Slack 
It is useful to know the amount of slack for the following reasons: 
· If the amount of slack for a particular resource is low, there is a danger that the resource could become a binding constraint if the availability of other scarce resources increases. Management may, therefore start to plan for additional supplies of the resource before they are needed. 
· If slack is high, it means that the availability of the resource exceeds the amount used by a significant amount. It may be possible to use this resource elsewhere in the business or sub-contract it to another business. 

4.3 More Than Two Variables 
A linear program can be formulated for any number of variables and any number of constraints. However, the methods used in this chapter based on drawing graphs are limited to solving problems with only two variables - represented by the x and y axes - although there can be any number of constraints. There are several methods of solving for more than two variables, including: 
· the dual problem; and 
· simplex. 


Summary:
· Where factors of production are scarce, production decisions have to be made to maximisecontribution (and hence profit) given limited resources.
· Where one resource is scarce, the approach is to rank products by contribution generated per unit of scarce resource (“key factor”).
· For make or buy decisions, the method is to rank products by saving per unit of scarce resource.
· Where there is more than one constraint, use linear programming: 1. Define variables. 2. Define the objective function (usually to maximise contribution). 3. Formulate constraints. 4. Plot constraints on a graph and identify the feasible area. 5. Use a sample contribution line to find the point on the feasible region that generates the highest contribution (i.e., furthest from the origin). 6. Solve the equation(s) for the optimal point in (5.) to specify the corresponding values of the variables. 7. Answer the question. Maximum profit MUST be calculated as maximum contribution less total fixed overheads, never using unit profit.
· The shadow price of a resource is the amount by which contribution would be increased if one more unit of the scarce resource were available.
· Slack arises when the company does not use all of an available resource. Slack can be calculated as resource available less resource used.




Chapter 7: Pricing
This chapter covers the following Learning Outcomes. C. Decision-Making Techniques 4. Pricing decisions a) Explain the factors that influence the pricing of a product or service. b) Calculate and explain the price elasticity of demand. c) Derive and manipulate a straight line demand equation.

1.1 Full Cost Plus Pricing 
The price of a product using full cost plus pricing is found as follows: 
|                                     | $/unit |
| Direct production costs             | X      |
| Absorption of overheads             |	       |
|    Variable production overhead     | X      |
|    Fixed production overhead        | X      |
|    Variable non-production overhead | X      |
|    Fixed non-production overhead    | X      |
| Full cost                           | X      |
| Mark-up percentage                  | X      |
| Selling price                       | X      |

Selling price Per unit = (Total budgeted production cost + Total budgeted non-production cost + Mark-up)/Budgeted sales units 

Advantages:
· If the budget sales level is achieved, profit will be made. 
· The full cost should be readily available if a system of standard costing is in operation. 
· Appropriate where fixed costs are significant. 
· Useful for justifying prices (and price rises). 
· Simple and cheap to operate. 
Disadvantages:
· The method of accounting for overheads will have a large impact on the costs calculated for different products. 
· If actual sales are below budget, losses may occur. 
· Ignores external factors (e.g. demand/ price relationship, competitors' prices). 
· The size of the mark-up is arbitrary. 
· It may not maximise profits. 

Key Point 
Full cost plus pricing is a long-term pricing strategy. It aims to ensure that prices cover all variable and fixed costs. 
The problems regarding overheads can be reduced using activity-based costing (see Chapter 2). A margin is added to this cost. 

1.2 Marginal Cost Plus Pricing 
Selling Per unit = (Budgeted Variable production cost + Budgeted Variable non-production cost + Mark-up)/Budgeted sales units 
Advantages:
· Mark-up represents contribution, which is useful in short-term pricing decisions (e.g. market penetration policy). 
· Treats fixed costs by their nature and not using an arbitrary allocation. 
Disadvantages:
· It may lead to failure to recover fixed costs. 
· It is not appropriate for long-term pricing, particularly where fixed costs are significant, because, in the long- term, fixed costs may also vary and not be sufficiently covered by mark-up. 

1.3 Return on Investment (ROI) 
Pricing Prices are set to achieve a target percentage return on the capital invested in production. 
Selling price per unit = Budgeted full cost + (target ROI percentage x capital employed)/Budgeted sales units
ROI pricing is a long-term pricing method. 
Advantages:
· Links price to both short-term costs and long-term capital employed
· Consistent with ROI as a performance measure. 
· Target ROI can be set to take account of risk. 
Disadvantages: 
· Ignores external factors. 
· Problems in calculating capital employed (e.g. whether to use book values or replacement cost). 
· Subjective split of shared investment between products.

1.4 Opportunity Cost 
Pricing Opportunity cost (relevant cost) pricing is a short-term strategy used to price: 
· one-off projects; 
· special orders; and 
· tenders for contracts. 
Production will use existing resources, and hence, a relevant costing approach is used: Price = Relevant costs + mark-up

Key Point 
A relevant cost basis provides a minimum price that can be used as the basis for a quotation. (The concept of relevant costs for decision-making has already been covered in Chapter 4.) 

Quiz: Opportunity Cost Price 
After spending $500 on market research, Bobco Engineering wants to bid on an important one-off contract and needs to ensure its costing is both competitive and commercially rational. To complete the project it will need to devote the following resources to its construction: 
· 1,500 kg of standard steel, which is regularly used in its production process. It currently has inventory of 6,000 kg purchased at an average price of $8/kg. With recent market conditions, the purchase cost is now $9.35/kg. 
· 500 kg of speciality steel. It has 500 kg of such steel in inventory. This was purchased 16 months ago at $12/kg. As it has not been used since purchasing, the auditors insisted on a write-down to an estimated net realisable value of $4/kg. The purchasing manager figures that he can sell it for scrap at $2/kg. If sold, the cost to remove it from the warehouse and deliver it would be $1,000. 
· 380 hours of unskilled labour. Although the current trade union contract pays $6/hour for such labour, extra workers would have to be hired in the "temporary" labour market at $7/hour. 
· 196 hours of semi-skilled labour paid $9/hour under the current trade union contract. Currently, there is a surplus of such labour in the plant. 
· 51 hours of skilled labour paid $18/hour under the current trade union contract. The workers are currently busy in another department, where they are producing output which is sold for $96 and which uses $15 of direct material, $9 of skilled labour, $27 of semi-skilled labour, $15 of variable overheads and $8 fixed-cost overheads allocated. It takes a half hour of skilled labour to work on this existing product. The department head has agreed to release his skilled workers but he must be compensated to be no worse off. 
· Use of equipment, which was scheduled to be disposed of this period for $12,000. If used in the project, it will have to be disposed of later at an estimated selling price of $4,000. 
· Exclusive use of a piece of manufacturing equipment (a fibrillator), which will not survive its use in the project. The machine originally cost $51,000 and currently has a carrying (i.e. book) value of $6,000. It could now be sold in the used fibrillator market for $8,000 (because new ones cost $45,000). If it was left in its existing use, it could generate cash flows with an estimated present value of $5,000. 
· 38 kg of Ecotox, which was originally purchased for $600/kg. Under current government environmental rules, Bobco will have to pay $3,000 for the recycling company to take it away if it is not used in the contract. 
Required: Calculate the price which Bobco should bid for the contract on the assumption that it wishes to charge a price equal to the relevant cost plus 25%.

1.5 Lifecycle Cost Pricing Following on from the discussion in Chapter 3, lifecycle cost pricing will not only consider current fixed and variable costs, but all the costs over the product's life. Over the product's lifetime, its total revenue should at least cover design, manufacture and closedown costs as well as costs of production. 1.6 Limitations of Cost-Based Approaches The limitations of the cost-based approaches discussed above include the following: 
· They ignore external factors such as demand and competition (see s.4). 
· They are unlikely to maximise profit, revenue or market share as mark-ups are subjective. 
· They may result in prices completely different from those charged by competitors. 
· Using a cost basis may underestimate the features in the product that are attractive to customers and could justify a higher price. 
Therefore, other factors, including demand, in particular, should be taken into account before the final price is decided. 

2.1 Demand Curve 
2.1.1 The Concept In the economist's model, demand means the total quantity of a product or service the buyers in a market would wish to buy in a given period. Demand depends on the price charged by suppliers. For most goods, as the price falls, demand for the goods rises.

2.1.2 Equation 
The demand curve can be expressed as an equation of the form: P = a - bQ 
where: P is the price which would achieve a given demand, Q; a = price when Q = 0; b is the slope of the line - it shows how much the price must change by to achieve a given increase in demand: 
b = change in price /change in quantity 

Example of Demand 
Alex owns the only bakery in a small town and is the only supplier of doughnuts. Based on an analysis of sales over the past 12 months, Alex has observed: 
· If the price of a doughnut is $5.00 (500 cents), demand is zero 
· For every 50 cents the price of a single doughnut decreases by, the number of doughnuts Alex sells increases by 20 
Based on Alex's observations, a = 500 cents and b = 2.5 (50/20=2.5) Alex has estimated the daily demand for doughnuts as follows: 
P = 500 - 2.5Q 
P is the price in cents, and Q is the daily demand in units. 
Alex could use this equation in several ways. For example, if Alex considered charging $1.50 (150 cents) per doughnut, the equation could be used to calculate demand at this price. 150 = (500 - 2.5 * 140) 
To solve the equation, Q equals 140. This shows that at a price of $1.50 (150 cents) each Alex would expect to sell 140 doughnuts. 

2.2 Marginal Revenue 
2.2.1 The Concept 
Marginal revenue - the increase in total revenue resulting from selling one additional unit of a product or service. 
There are two effects on total revenue of selling one more unit: 1. An additional unit has been sold; this increases revenue. 2. To sell an extra unit, the price will have to be reduced for all units sold; this reduces total revenue. 
When marginal revenue is positive, the effect on revenue of the extra quantity sold outweighs the impact of the fall in price. When marginal revenue is negative, the fall in price has a more significant effect than the increase in quantity sold. 

2.2.2 Equation The marginal revenue function can be derived from the demand function as follows: 
Price: P = a - bQ 
It can be shown using a mathematical technique (calculus) that: 
Marginal revenue = a - 2bQ

Quiz: Marginal Revenue 
A company has estimated the following price/quantity relationship for one of its products: 
| $  |Units|
| 40 | 10  |
| 25 | 20  |
| 10 | 30  |
Required: a. Plot the demand function on a graph and find its equation. b. Find the total revenue function. c. Find the marginal revenue function. Note that this exercise is for illustration only. Candidates will not be required to plot graphs in the examination. *

Answer:
a. Draw the Demand function on a graph (not required at the exam) 
b. Total revenue, TR = 55Q - 1.5Q2 
c. Marginal revenue, MR 
Marginal revenue = a- 2bQ 
From part (a) a = 55, b = 1.5 therefore marginal revenue = 55 - 3Q.

2.3 Marginal Cost 
Marginal cost - the increase in total cost from producing and selling one additional unit of a product or service. 
Economists assume that marginal cost changes as output increases. Initially, marginal cost falls as output rises due to economies of scale. However, once the lowest marginal cost has been achieved, the marginal cost rises as output increases further. Accountants (and examiners) take a more straightforward approach and assume that marginal cost equals variable cost per unit (at least until full capacity is reached). The marginal cost is usually constant since it is generally assumed that the variable cost of each unit does not change, regardless of how many units are produced. However, where there are volume-based discounts on raw materials or components (i.e. discounts are available when agreed quantities are purchased), marginal cost will fall to a lower amount for all subsequent units produced. 
Key Point 
Marginal cost is incremental and therefore relevant in evaluating a decision to increase production and sales. 

Example of Volume-Based Discount 
The variable cost of product Y is as follows: 
|                     		  	    | $   |

If more than 1,000 kg are purchased in a month, the supplier will give a 5% discount on all materials. The marginal cost would then be as follows: More than 1,000 units When the discount is achieved the marginal cost becomes:

Between 950 units and 1,000 units 
he material cost of producing 1,000 units is $95,000 as the discounted price applies. This is the same as the material cost of producing 950 units without the discount. Therefore, to produce 951 units or more, 1,000 kg should be purchased to take advantage of the discount. So the marginal cost for between 950 units and 1,000 units is as follows: 
|					| Output  	| Total variable cost | Marginal cost |

No additional materials would be acquired until production exceeds 1,000 units, so the marginal cost is $70 up to 1,000 units. Fewer than 950 units For fewer than 950 units, the marginal cost is the variable cost without discounts - that is $170 per unit.

2.4 Maximising Profits 
The objective of most businesses is to maximise profits. The economist's model is used to find the price that will meet this objective. This is determined as follows: 
· Identify the quantity of sales (Q) that would lead to maximum profits. This is the quantity at which: 
Marginal cost = Marginal revenue . 
· Calculate the price that must be set in order to achieve this level of sales by putting the value of Q into the demand function: 
P = a - bQ 

2.5 Summary of Algebraic Method 
The method used above to calculate the profit maximising output is called the algebraic method. A summary of the steps that would be taken to identify the profit maximising output and price is as follows: 1. Establish the demand function, which has the form P = a - bQ. 2. Establish the equation for marginal revenue, which has the form MR = a - 2bQ. 3. Identify the marginal cost function. Typically, marginal cost = variable cost, so the marginal cost function will be in the form MC = x (where x is a number). 4. Solve the equation MC = MR. This gives the value of Q at the point of maximum profit. 5. Put the value of Q into the demand function (from Step 1) to determine the price that should be charged so that demand equals Q. 

2.6 Tabular Approach 
An alternative approach to identifying the profit maximising point of output is to use the tabular approach. This approach may be used where information has been given about the level of demand for a small number of different prices and: 
· due to the small number of items there is insufficient data to calculate a price equation accurately; or 
· the relationship between the price and demand does not appear to be linear. 
In these cases, marginal revenue and marginal cost can be calculated for each set of data. There may not be any point where marginal cost = marginal revenue exactly. In this case, produce up to the last point where marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost.

Based on this, determine the price to maximise profit and the associated quantity to be produced. b. Calculate total profit at each price and confirm that the price and quantity calculated in (a) maximise profit. 

Answer:
a. Marginal cost and marginal revenue

Profit is maximised by setting a price of 302 cents and producing and selling 6 cakes each day (since this is the point at which marginal revenue is almost the same as marginal cost). The marginal revenue and cost for 7 cakes show that if production is increased to 7, revenue would increase by 71 cents, and costs would increase by 187 cents. Therefore, it would not be worth producing that seventh unit. 

b. Total profit 
| Price | Quantity | Total revenue | Total cost | Total profit |
| 460   | 1        | 460           | 385        | 75           |
| 420   | 2        | 840           | 570        | 270          |
| 380   | 3        | 1,140         | 749        | 391          |
| 360   | 4        | 1,440         | 932        | 508          |
| 325   | 5        | 1,625         | 1,100      | 525          |
| 302   | 6        | 1,812         | 1,280      | 532          |
| 269   | 7        | 1,883         | 1,467      | 416          |
| 244   | 8        | 1,952         | 1,656      | 296          |
| 212   |          | 1,908         | 1,847      | 61           |
| 180   | 10       | 1,800         | 2,030      | (230)        |
This table confirms the conclusion in part (a) that the profit maximising price is 302 cents for 6 cakes.

2.7 Practical Disadvantages of the Economist's Model 
· Although the economist's model appears to be logical, it is difficult to apply in practice for the following reasons: 
Organisations are unlikely to be able to estimate demand curves for their products or services with any degree of accuracy. 
· The demand curve ignores exogenous variables (i.e. variables outside of the control of management which may affect price), such as market conditions. 
· In practice, demand for products may be interrelated. However, demand curves treat demand for each product as independent of demand for other products. 
· Companies may have strategies other than profit maximisation (e.g. maximisation of market share or achieving a particular target profit). 

2.8 Production and Sales Levels A decision to increase production and sales levels should, like any decision, consider relevant costs (see Chapter 4). These include consideration of marginal revenue and marginal cost. However, there are many other factors, some of which are inter-related, that can make evaluation of this decision quite difficult. For example: 
· One of the implications of increasing production may be the need for increased storage space for raw materials and/or finished goods. The cost of additional storage space is not a variable cost but a fixed cost. 
· Selling price usually has a significant effect on demand. When following a particular pricing strategy (see next section), a business will need to have production capacity to meet the demand generated. 
· Increasing production may have consequences on the quality of the product (e.g. more defective items). This would not only result in additional costs (e.g. in monitoring quality control and repairs) but might lead to: - customers turning to other suppliers of more reliable products; - the selling price being driven down; and/or - reputational damage (of a brand name). 

3.1 Market Skimming
Market skimming is often used when a product is launched. A high price is set initially, which generally means that demand will be low. However, a large profit margin can be made during this stage. Later, when the early adopter segment of the market is satisfied, the price may be lowered so that sales can be made to a larger market segment. Market skimming is most likely to be used in the following situations: 
· To launch a new product into a market where there is no existing competition. This is typically a "breakthrough" product. Examples of breakthrough products include the car, penicillin, laptop computer, Windows operating system, ATM and iPad. Breakthrough services include the Internet and online shopping. 
· The product confers some status on the customer. For example, when mobile phones were first launched commercially in the 1980s, the cost of a handset was about $2,500. Having a mobile telephone was a symbol of importance. 
· The product has a short lifecycle, and it is desirable to recover the development costs as quickly as possible. 

3.2 Market Penetration 
Market penetration may also be used when launching a product into a new market. However, it is the opposite of market skimming, as a low price is charged initially to attract new customers. The initial price may even lead the manufacturer to make a loss in the short term. Once a customer base has been established, the price is increased. Market penetration is most likely to be used in the following situations: 
· For commodity-type products where there are many existing products available. The only way to break into the market is to sell for a lower price than the existing products. 
· For price-sensitive products (i.e. a small reduction in price is expected to result in a large increase in demand). This high price elasticity of demand is discussed in more detail in s.4.2. 
· For products where economies of scale exist (i.e. if large quantities are produced the cost per unit falls significantly). 

3.3 Complementary Product Pricing 
The use of one product often requires the purchase of a second product (e.g. cars cannot run without fuel; printers require ink cartridges). Demand for such complementary products is therefore linked. Complementary product pricing requires understanding of the impact that the price of one product may have on demand for the other. When setting prices the impact on demand for the complementary product may be considered to be more important than the demand or profit relating to the first product. 

Example of Complementary Products 
Printers for computers are often sold at a relatively low price; once a particular model of printer has been acquired, the user has to buy a particular print cartridge. The price of the print cartridges is then relatively high because a large margin can be made on them. Consumers have no choice but to buy those cartridges unless they invest in a new printer. 

3.4 Price Discrimination 
Price discrimination involves setting different prices for a product or service in different markets. Customers in some markets may be willing to pay higher prices than customers in other markets, so price discrimination aims to achieve the maximum price in each available market. For price discrimination to be feasible there must be barriers between markets, otherwise investors would buy in the lower price market and resell in the higher price market, undermining the objective of discriminating. Examples of price discrimination include: 
· Where switching can be prevented by selling a product to consumers for: - Unique moments in time (e.g. airline tickets for a specific flight that cannot be resold under any circumstances or cheaper rail tickets that are valid for a particular rail service); - Unique locations (e.g. a return airline or train ticket from location A to location B may be priced differently from a return ticket from location B to location A). 
· Software businesses often offer heavy discounts for educational users. For example, subscriptions to office productivity software are usually cheaper for students and educational institutions. Educational purchasers must provide evidence of their status. 
· Charging different tariffs and service charges for commercial customers and residential customers. 

3.5 Loss Leaders 
A loss leader is a product that is sold at a loss to attract customers who will then buy other products. Loss leaders are common in supermarket promotions, where products are advertised at very low, loss- making prices. The supermarkets know that once customers have entered the store to buy the promotional product, they are likely to also buy other goods. 

3.6 Going-Rate Pricing This means charging the prevailing market price. This approach might be used in competitive markets (i.e. where charging above market price would lead to a loss of the majority of customers and selling below market price would not bring additional customers). Going-rate pricing is common for homogeneous products that have minimum variation (e.g. commodities such as aluminium or diesel). 

3.7 Product-Line Pricing Some products are related because they are sold to the same customer or through the same outlets. Product-line pricing involves setting the price of the products in the product line together. There are two prevalent approaches: 1. Product bundling (i.e. a group of products are sold together for a price that is less than the total of the individual products). This is common in fast-food restaurants (e.g. "meal deals" containing a burger, soft drink and french fries for less than the total price of the individual items). The rationale for this approach is that the extra revenue from the third item exceeds the cost of the third item. 2. Set differentials between different products in a range. For example, a price is set for a basic car with a small engine, and other versions (e.g. a larger engine) are sold for the basic price plus a pre-determined differential. 

3.8 Volume Discounting 
Many organisations offer discounts to customers who buy a certain number of products. In retail stores, for example, it is quite common to see "buy one, get one for 50%" promotional pricing. The reason for using such a strategy is twofold: 1. To offer a more competitive price overall (as the average price paid for two items will be lower than the price for one). 2. To acknowledge the law of diminishing marginal utility (i.e., the consumer gets the most satisfaction from the first unit of a product or service). As subsequent units of a product or service are consumed, the satisfaction derived from them declines. Offering the second item for a lower price encourages consumers to buy it even though it provides less satisfaction. 

3.9 Relevant Cost Pricing Relevant cost pricing, or opportunity cost pricing, is often used for one-off contracts or orders. The relevant cost of the contract is calculated, and then a mark-up is added to get the price. 

4.1 Level of Demand Demand is the quantity of a good or service which consumers want, and are willing and able to pay for. In practice, an organisation may not know the demand curve for their product or service. The level of demand, however, will still influence pricing; the higher the demand, the higher the price that can be charged. Demand is influenced by the following: 
· Income. Demand for most goods rises when consumers' incomes rise. However, demand for inferior goods (e.g. cheap meat) might fall as incomes rise. 
· Price of substitute goods. If substitutes are available for a much lower price, consumers may buy the substitutes instead. 
· Price of complementary goods. Complementary goods are goods which are bought together, for example, petrol and cars. US car manufacturers expect to see a fall in demand for large vehicles when the price of petrol increases. 
· Consumer tastes and fashion. For example, in Western Europe, there is a trend towards buying organically grown vegetables, so demand for these products is high. 
· Advertising. Spending on advertising can increase a product's demand. 
· Consumer views and capacity to pay. These will ultimately determine how much consumers are prepared to pay for products. 

4.2 Price Elasticity of Demand 
The price elasticity of demand (PED) is the degree of sensitivity of demand for a good to changes in the price of that good.
PED = % change in demand/% change in price
PED will generally be negative since a rise in price leads to a fall in demand. However, by convention, the minus sign is ignored when describing PED (e.g. if calculated as "- 1.5", it is described as "1.5"). Demand for a product can be described as: 
· Elastic- meaning that demand is very responsive to changes in price. The change in the quantity of goods demanded will be relatively greater (i.e. in percentage terms) than the change in price. The PED will be greater than one. 
· Inelastic- meaning that a change in price will have little impact on demand. Demand will change by a relatively small amount (i.e. in percentage terms) than the change in price. The PED will be less than one. 
If demand is elastic (i.e. PED > 1.0), increasing the price may lead to reduced revenue. 
If demand is inelastic (i.e. PED < 1.0), price rises can increase revenue (e.g. necessity goods). PED at point 1 =

Quiz: Price Elasticity of Demand 
Alex, a baker, has ascertained that the daily demand for doughnuts has the following demand function: P = 500 - 0.1Q Where P is the price in cents, and Q is the daily demand in units. 
Required: Calculate the price elasticity of demand based on Alex increasing the price by 5 cents, assuming that his current price per doughnut is: a. $4 b. $2 

Answer:
a. Current Price $4 
At a price of P1 = 400 cents, daily demand (Q,) is 1,000 doughnuts (W). If the price rises by 5 cents to P2 = 405 cents, daily demand (Q2) will fall to 950 doughnuts. 
PED = ((Q2-Q1)/Q1)/((P2-P1)/P1) = ((950-1,000)/1,000)/((405-400)/400) = -0.05/0.0125 = - 4. 
Ignoring the minus sign, elasticity is 4 when the current price is $4. As this is greater than 1, demand is elastic at this point. 
b. Current Price $2 
At a price of P1 = 200 cents, daily demand (Q,) is 3,000 doughnuts (Woring). If the price rises by 5 cents to P2 = 205 cents, daily demand (Q2) will fall to 2,950 doughnuts. 
PED = [(2,950 - 3,000)/3,000]/[(205 - 200)/200] = - 0.0167/0.025 = - 0.67 
Ignoring the minus sign, elasticity is 0.67 when the current price is $2. This shows that the elasticity of demand varies along the demand curve. 

WORKING 
Demand function: P = 500 - 0.1Q 
At the current price of 400 cents: 400 = 500 - 0.1Q 
Therefore, 0.1Q = 100 
Therefore, Q = 1,000 (i.e. daily demand of 1,000 doughnuts) 
Similarly: 
If P = 405: 405 = 500 - 0.1Q therefore, 0.1Q = 95, Q = 950 
If P = 200: 200 = 500 - 0.1Q therefore, 0.1Q = 300, Q = 3,000 
If P = 205: 205 = 500 - 0.1Q therefore, 0.1Q = 295, Q = 2,950

4.3 Product Lifecycle One influence on a product's price is its lifecycle (see Chapter 3). Different pricing policies might be adopted at different stages as follows: 
· Introduction stage: Price skimming or penetration pricing may be used (see above). . Growth phase: If price skimming has been used, the price will be reduced during this phase. If penetration pricing has been used, the price will start to rise during this phase once the business is confident about having sufficient customer loyalty. 
· Maturity phase: At this stage, it is likely that profit maximisation pricing policies will be used (see the economist's model described previously). 
· Decline phase: Lower prices may be charged to sell off excess inventories. However, in some industries, products that have reached the end of their lifecycles may become specialty items, where there is still demand from a small section of the market. For example, vinyl records of music up until the 1980s are collector items for those who prefer vinyl to CDs, etc. 

4.4 Competitors If there are many competing suppliers in the market, an individual company may have little power to influence prices. On the other hand, a monopolist can dominate the market and set the price. If a business has competitors, it must consider their possible reaction to its pricing policy. For example, cutting prices could lead to retaliation - a price war (this is common in supermarkets). 

4.5 Customers If a business has one dominant customer, it may find it difficult to increase prices and might be forced to offer volume ("bulk buy") discounts. Businesses that offer services sometimes try to attract "prestige" clients by offering low prices. The hope is to improve reputation and attract other clients, who will then pay regular prices. 

4.6 Perfect Competition 
Perfect competition is a theoretical concept which describes a market in which: 
· there are many sellers; 
· there are many buyers; · products are identical/homogeneous; 
· no barriers to entry exist; and 
· there is perfect information (no hidden information, buyers know everything about the goods they are buying). 
The sale and purchase of goods will be at the market clearing (or equilibrium) price, which is the prevailing price where supply and demand are equal, with no excess or shortage. Market participants have no decision to make regarding price. Individual businesses are not big enough to influence the total output of the market significantly. They are "price takers" - they must accept the market price. 
If an individual company were to charge a price higher than the market price, it would not make any sales, because buyers have perfect information and will know that they can buy at a lower price from the other suppliers in the market. There is no incentive for a company to sell for a price below the market price because it can sell all of its output for the market price. In a competitive market, businesses will charge the market price. 

Summary:
· Cost plus pricing methods involve adding a given margin to the cost of a product. The cost may be the marginal cost, the full cost or even the relevant cost.
· Full cost plus pricing is a long-term pricing strategy. It ensures that prices cover all variable and fixed costs.
· Opportunity cost (relevant cost) pricing is suitable for short-term pricing decisions.
· A significant weakness of cost plus methods of pricing is that they do not consider demand.
· In the economist's model, price is a function of the quantity demanded. As the price falls, demand increases.
· Marginal revenue is the increase in total revenues resulting from selling one more unit of a product or service.
· For exam purposes, marginal cost is equal to variable cost per unit (at least until full capacity is reached).
· A business maximises its profit when marginal revenue equals marginal cost.
· Pricing is a strategic decision and different pricing strategies are applied in different circumstances (e.g. when demand for one product is linked to demand for another).
· The price elasticity of demand is a measure of the degree of sensitivity of demand for a good to changes in the price of that good.



Chapter 8: Risk and Uncertainty
This chapter covers the following Learning Outcomes. C. Decision-Making Techniques 6. Dealing with risk and uncertainty in decision making a) Suggest research techniques to reduce uncertainty (e.g. focus groups, market research). b) Explain the use of simulation, expected values and sensitivity. c) Apply expected values and sensitivity to decision-making problems. d) Apply the techniques of maximax, maximin and minimax regret to decision-making problems, including the production of profit tables. e) Interpret a decision tree and use it to solve a multi-stage decision problem. f) Calculate the value of perfect and imperfect information. 

1.1 Introduction 
Risk - the existence of several possible outcomes, which are known in advance along with the related probability. 
Uncertainty - the potential outcomes of a decision that are not known in advance. 
So far, decision-making questions have assumed that the results of various courses of action are known with certainty. In the real world, this is seldom the case. Decisions often have to be made where various uncertain outcomes could result from the decision being made. 

1.2 Methods The following methods of dealing with risk in decision making are examinable: 
· Expected value; 
· Value of perfect information; 
· Decision trees; 
· Maximax; 
· Maximin; and 
· Minimax regret.
Exam advice You must also be aware of practical ways to deal with uncertainty (see s.5). 

2.1 The Concept 
The expected value represents the average outcome that would be achieved if a decision were repeated many times. 
Expected value (EV) = Weighted arithmetic mean of possible outcomes = Σ (xi p(xi)) 
This formula represents the sum (E) of each possible outcome (Xi) multiplied by its probability of occurring (p(xi)).
Generally, the decision rule would be to choose the outcome with the highest EV. 

Key Point 
The sum of the probabilities of all outcomes must equal to 1. 

Example of Expected Value 
When an unbiased six-sided die is thrown, each side has an equal chance (1/6) of being obtained. The expected value of throwing a dice many times is calculated as: 
| Value              | Probability | Product |
| Xi                 | p(xi)       | xip(xi) |
| 1                  | 1/6         | 1/6     |
| 2                  | 1/6         | 2/6     |
| 3                  | 1/6         | 3/6     |
| 4                  | 1/6         | 4/6     |
| 5                  | 1/6         | 5/6     |
| 6                  | 1/6         | 6/6     |
| Total Σ(xi ρ (xi)) |             | 21/6    |  
The EV is, therefore, 21/6 or 3.5. 
This means that if the dice is thrown many times (many iterations of the event), the average value of the throws would be 3.5. It is important to note that for a single throw (event), it is impossible to get 3.5 because there is no single outcome (dice face) which has a value of 3 1/2.

Quiz: Expected Value 
A decision-maker must select one of three mutually exclusive projects. The outcome from each project depends on the state of the market, which can be diminishing, static or expanding. The profit for each project under each of the three outcomes is shown in the following payoff (profit) table: 
| State of the market | Probability | Project 1 | Project 2 | Project 3 |
|                     |             |
| Diminishing         | 0.4         | 100       | 0         | 180       |
| Static              | 0.3         | 200       | 500       | 190       |
| Expanding           | 0.3         | 1,000     | 600       | 200       |
The decision rule would be to choose the project with the highest EV.

Required: Determine the expected value (EV) for each project and select which project to pursue. 

Answer:
|                                                   |                                              | $000 |
| Project 1                                         | EV=(100 × 0.4) + (200 × 0.3) + (1,000 × 0.3) | 400  |
| Project 2                                         | EV=(0 × 0.4) + (500 × 0.3) + (600 × 0.3)     | 330  |
| Project 3                                         | EV=(180 × 0.4) + (190 × 0.3) + (200 × 0.3)   | 189  |
Based on the EVs, Project 1 should be undertaken.

2.1.1 Advantages of EV:
· It reduces the information to one number for each choice. 
· The idea of an average is easily understood. 

2.1.2 Limitations of EV:
· The probabilities of the different possible outcomes may be difficult to estimate. 
· The average may not correspond to any of the possible outcomes. 
· Unless the same decision has to be made many times, the average will not be achieved; it is therefore unsuitable for decision making in "one-off " situations. 
· The average gives no indication of the spread of possible results (i.e. it ignores risk). 

2.2 Profit Tables 
A profit table (also referred to as a payoff matrix) shows all possible "payoffs" (NPVs, contribution, profits, etc.) which may result from a decision-maker's chosen strategy. The data given in Activity 1 is in the form of a payoff matrix.
Exam advice You may be required to calculate the profit table based on the information given in the question.

Quiz: Profit Table 
A baker sells a cake that costs $0.10 to make for $0.30 each. At the end of a day any cakes not sold must be thrown away. On any particular day the level of demand follows the following probability distribution: 
| Number of cakes sold | 20  | 40  | 60  |
| Probability          | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.2 |
The following template may be used: 
|    |		|                   Order Size			    |
|    | Demand   |      20              40              60           |
| 20 | (Pr 0.3) |                                                   |
| 40 | (Pr 0.5) | (outcomes are computed in this part of the table) |
| 60 | (Pr 0.2) |                                                   |
Required: a. Construct a profit table to show the possible outcomes. b. Calculate the daily order the baker should place in order to maximize the expected value of daily profits. 

Answer: 
a. Profit Table (in $) 
                |       Order Size     |
|    |   Demand | 20    | 40   | 60    |
| 20 | (Pr 0.3) | 4.00  | 2.00 | 0 0   |
| 40 | (Pr 0.5) | 4.00  | 8.00 | 6.00  |
| 60 | (Pr 0.2) | 4.00  | 8.00 | 12.00 |
Sample workings:
If order q = 20 and demand = 20, profit = (20 × 0.30) - (20 × 0.10) = $4.00 
If order q = 20 and demand = 40, sales are limited to 20 i.e. profit $4.00. 

b. EV if order 20 = ($4 * 0.3) + ($4 * 0.5) + ($4 * 0.2) = $4.00 
   EV if order 40 = ($2 * 0.3) + ($8 * 0.5) + ($8 * 0.2) = $6.20 
   EV if order 60 =((0 * 0.3) + ($6 * 0.5) + ($12 * 0.2)) = $5.40
The baker should always order 40 and make, on average, $6.20.

2.3 Value of Perfect Information 
2.3.1 The Concept 
Imagine that, in a situation of uncertainty, it is possible to buy an accurate forecast which predicts with certainty what the uncertain variable is going to be each time a decision has to be made. The value of perfect information is the maximum amount a decision-maker would be willing to pay for advance information to know which outcome will occur.

2.3.2 Calculation 
Expected value with perfect information is the expected daily profit the baker would earn if he ordered the forecast and acted on it. Some days the forecast will say that demand will be 20 cakes, other days 40 cakes, and so on. It is assumed that the probability distribution of the forecast is the same as the probability distribution of the underlying variable (i.e. demand for cakes). 
Value of perfect information = EV with perfect information - EV without perfect information 

2.4 Value of Imperfect Information 
In the real world, it is unlikely that any forecast would be perfect. In the case of the baker, the daily forecast would not always be accurate. Even with an inaccurate forecast, however, the baker may make a higher expected return than with no forecast at all. 
Value of imperfect information = EV with imperfect information - EV without information 

Example of Imperfect Information 
A newsagent has to decide how many newspapers to buy each day. Demand is uncertain and can either be high, with a probability of 60%, or low, with a probability of 40%. A profit table shows the profits for the possible combinations of order size and demand: 
|        |      |  Order Size  |  
|	 | 	|High   | Low  |
| Demand | High | 1,000 | 400  |
|        | Low  | (200) | 400  |
EV without information 
Without any additional information, the newsagent would order the quantity which gives the highest expected profit: The expected outcome of placing a high order is $520 ((1,000 * 0.6) + ((200) * 0.4)). The expected outcome of placing a low order is $400 ((400 * 0.6) + ((400) * 0.4)). 
EV with imperfect information The newsagent can commission a survey telling him the demand on a particular day. If the survey says demand will be high on a specific day, he will place a high order; if it says demand will be low on a particular day, he will place a low order. There is a 60% chance that the survey will say high and a 40% chance that the survey will say low. The survey is not always correct, and there is a 90% chance it will be correct. If the newsagent commissions the survey, the following profits, along with their associated probabilities, would be possible: 
|                                   | Profit ($) | Probability      |
| Survey says high and is correct   | 1,000      | 0.54 (0.6 * 0.9) |
| Survey says high and is incorrect | (200       | 0.06 (0.6 * 0.1) |
| Survey says low and is correct    | 400        | 0.36 (0.4 * 0.9) |
| Survey says low and is incorrect  | 400        | 0.04 (0.4 * 0.1) |

EV with imperfect information = (1,000 * 0.54) + ((200) * 0.06) + (400 * 0.36) + (400 * 0.04) = $688. 
The value of imperfect information in this case is: 
EV with the survey $688 
EV without the survey $520 
Value of imperfect information $168 

EVs of perfect and imperfect information can be calculated more easily using decision trees (s.2.5). 


2.5 Decision Trees 
2.5.1 Concept Decision making often involves multi-stage decisions. At each stage in the decision-making process, the decision maker has to choose between two or more decisions. The possible outcomes of each decision will be specified, along with the associated probability. Having made the first decision, a second decision, or possibly even more decisions, may be required. A "decision" tree helps visualise and evaluate outcomes in the decision-making process. It is a pictorial representation of the decisions which need to be made at each stage, along with their potential outcomes and associated probabilities. 
Exam advice You will not be required to draw a decision tree in the exam. However, you may be required to recommend the best course of action based on a decision tree given in a question. 

2.5.2 Conventions and Process 
Decision trees are usually drawn from left to right, with preceding decisions on the left with each subsequent decision and outcome further to the right. The following conventions are used in drawing decision trees: 
· Decision fork (point) - this is a point at which a decision- maker has to decide between two or more decisions. 
· Chance fork (outcome point) - this occurs where there are several possible outcomes. Normally, for each decision taken, there will be two or more possible outcomes. 

Key Point 
The sum of the probabilities of all outcomes (branch) at each chance fork must equal 1 or 100%. 

Having drawn the decision tree, it is necessary to calculate the expected outcome at each decision fork. To do this process, start at the right-hand side of the decision tree and work back to each decision fork to identify which is the best decision at each fork. Ultimately, the decision tree enables the decision-maker to determine the best decision to make at the first stage. 

Example of Decision Tree Process 
A company is considering investing in a new machine. This would involve an initial expenditure of $50,000 on patent rights, and profit in the coming year could be: 
$300,000 with probability 0.6 or $200,000 with probability 0.4 
If the company does not invest in the machine, profits for next year will be: 
$250,000 with probability 0.7 or $150,000 with probability 0.3 
This can be illustrated as follows: 
Node A (now) -> Node B (investment is made $50,000) -> profit $300,000 with probability 0.6
Node A (now) -> Node B (investment is made $50,000) -> profit $200,000 with probability 0.4
Node A (now) -> Node C (investment not made) -> profit $250,000 with probability 0.7
Node A (now) -> Node C (investment not made) -> profit $150,000 with probability 0.3
At chance fork B: Expected profits are $260,000 ((0.6 * 300,000) + (0.4 * $200,000)). 
At chance fork C: Expected profits are $220,000 ((0.7 * 250,000) + (0.3 * $150,000)). 
At decision point A: Either invest: Expected outcome is $210,000 (260,000 - 50,000). Or do not invest: Expected profit is $220,000.
Conclusion: The investment should not be made.

Quiz: Decision Trees 
Slim Foods is considering launching a non-sugar snack bar into a new market. Although the company has not yet undertaken any market research, the marketing director estimates that the product has a 60% chance of success and a 40% chance of failure in the market. A market research company has offered to do research in the new market before the company decides on whether to launch the product. Management believes there is a 60% chance the market research will recommend the launch and a 40% chance it will advise Slim Foods not to launch the product. The cost of the market research will be $30,000. The market research company has admitted that its research findings do not always turn out to be as expected once the product has been launched. The company advises that if it recommends the launch, there would be an 80% chance the product would succeed and a 20% chance it would fail. If it does not recommend the launch, there would be a 30% chance that the product would succeed if management were to launch it and a 70% chance that it would fail. In all cases, if the product succeeded, the present value of future profits from the product would be $10 million (excluding the market research costs). If the product failed, the net present value of the loss would be $4.5 million (excluding the market research costs). The company's directors are trying to decide whether to accept the market research company's offer or make a decision based only on the gut feel of the marketing director. 

Required: a. Draw a decision tree to illustrate the possible decisions and their associated potential outcomes. b. Advise management how they should proceed. c. Calculate the value of the imperfect information provided by the market research company. 

a. Draw the Decision Tree based on the information given.
Node A (now) -> Node B (market research $30,000) -> Node D (launch recommended at 0.6 probability) -> Node G (launch) -> Success (present value of future profits $10million with probability 0.8)
Node A (now) -> Node B (market research $30,000) -> Node D (launch recommended at 0.6 probability) -> not launch -> $0
Node A (now) -> Node B (market research $30,000) -> Node E (launch not recommended at 0.4 probability) -> Node H (launch) -> Success (present value of future profits $10million with probability 0.3)
Node A (now) -> Node B (market research $30,000) -> Node E (launch not recommended at 0.4 probability) -> Node H (launch) -> Success (present value of future profits -$4.5 million with probability 0.7)
Node A (now) -> Node B (market research $30,000) -> Node E (launch not recommended at 0.4 probability) -> Do not launch -> $0
Node A (now) -> Node C (no research) -> Node F (launch) -> Success (present value of future profits $10million with probability 0.6)
Node A (now) -> Node C (no research) -> Node F (launch) -> Fail -> $0
Node A (now) -> Node C (no research) -> (Do not launch) -> $0

b. Advice to Management 
Expected Present Value of Profits with Market Research 
At outcome point G (launching), the EV is $7,100,000 ((10 million * 0.8) + (-4.5 million * 0.2)). 
This is higher than zero (not launching), so the decision at point D would be to launch, and the EV here is $7,100,000. 
At outcome point H, EV is - $150,000 ((10 million * 0.3) + (-4.5 million * 0.7)). 
This is less than not launching the product, so the decision at point E is not to launch the product.
Therefore, at outcome point B (market research recommendation), if the product launch is recommended, it will be launched. If it is not recommended, it will not be launched. 
At outcome point B, the expected outcome is $4,260,000 ((0.6 * 7,100,000) + (0.4 * 0)). 
To get from point A to point B, the company has to pay $30,000 for market research. $4,230,000. 
Expected Present Value of Profits Without Market Research 
At outcome point F, the expected net present value of profits is $4,200,000 ((10 million * 0.6) + (-4.5 million * 0.4)). The decision at point C is therefore to launch, as the net present value of not launching is zero. Therefore, the expected present value of profits at C is also $4,200,000. No cost is involved in getting from A to C, so the expected net present value of profits is $4,200,000 if market research is not carried out. 
Conclusion: The market research should be undertaken. This is because the net present value of profits is higher by $30,000 ($4,230,000 - $4,200,000) with market research. 

c. Value of Imperfect Information The value of imperfect information is simply the difference between the expected value if the market research is commissioned and the expected value if it is not:
|                                | $000  |           |
| EV with the market research    | 4,260 | (point B) |
| EV without market research     | 4,200 | (point C) |
| Value of imperfect information | 60    |           |

3.1 Three Types of Decision-Makers 
Not all managers will make the same decision even though they have the same information; as individuals, they have different attitudes toward risk. 1. Risk-seekers are those who seek the maximum possible return regardless of the probability of it occurring. As optimists, they consider the best-case scenario. 2. Risk neutral are those who consider the most likely outcome. 3. Risk averse decision-makers dislike risk and make decisions based on the worst possible outcome (to minimise potential loss). There are different decision rules or criteria that correspond to these attitudes to risk.

3.2 Decision Rules 
| MAXIMAX             | Select the alternative with the maximum possible payoff (i.e., the highest return under the best-case scenario). The risk seeker's (i.e. optimist's) rule.                                                                 |
| MAXIMIN             | Select the alternative with the highest return under the worst-case scenario. The pessimist's rule (i.e. risk averse).                                                                                                     |
| MINIMAX REGRET      | Select the alternative with the lowest maximum regret. Regret is defined as the opportunity loss from having made the wrong decision. Minimax regret is also suited to investors that are adverse to missing out.          |
| EXPECTED VALUE (EV) | Select the option that gives the highest EV. Those who use EVs may be described as risk neutral (i.e. they are not concerned with the amount of risk associated with each option, only the amount of the expected return). |

Example of Decision Outcomes 
An ice cream seller needs to decide how large an order to place for ice cream (small, medium or large), taking into consideration the weather forecast (cold, warm or hot). The payoff table for the possible combinations of order size and weather is as follows: 
|             |     Weather     |
|             | Cold |Warm| Hot |
| Daily order |      |    |     |
| Small       | 250  | 200| 150 |
| Medium      | 200  | 500| 300 |
| Large       | 100  | 300| 750 |
The highest payoff for each order size is the order size most appropriate for the weather (i.e. small/cold, medium/warm and large/hot). Otherwise, profits are lost from either unsold ice cream or lost potential sales. 
Maximax: Taking an optimistic view, the ice cream seller would place a large order as this has the highest payoff, $750 (compared with the highest payoffs of $250 and $500 for small and medium orders, respectively). 
Maximin: Taking a cautious approach, placing a medium order has the highest of the lowest payoffs, $200 (compared with $150 and $100 for small and large orders, respectively). 
Minimax regret: From the payoff table above, determine the best choice in each weather condition: 
| Weather | Best choice (highest payoff, regret = 0) |
| Cold    | Small                                    |
| Warm    | Medium                                   |
| Hot     | Large                                    |
The optimal decision for cold weather is a small order, yielding $250. In cold weather, a medium order will have a regret of $50 (payoff is $50 lower than a small order), while a large order will have a regret of $150. 
Applying the same calculations for warm and hot weather, the table of regrets is as follows: 


Maximum regret Daily order Outcome at best Regrets $250 0 300 600 $500 50 450 $750 150 200 
|             |                 | Weather                    | Maximum regret|
|             |                 | Cold    | Warm    | Hot    |
| Daily order | Outcome at best |          Regrets                    
| Small       | $250            | 0       | 300     | 600    | 600 |
| Medium      | $500            | 50      | 0       | 450    | 450 |
| Large       | $750            | 150     | 200     | 0      | 200 |
The decision which corresponds to the smallest maximum regret, $200, is to place a large order. Note: The decision-maker can only pick the order size and hope for optimal conditions. Interpreting the table of regrets, the small order has the best payoff in cold weather, but the decision- maker may suffer a maximum regret of $600 if the weather is hot. The point is to minimise the maximum regret the decision-maker may suffer in unfavourable conditions (when the choice made is not optimum given the scenario).

Answer:
a. Maximax Project selected - 1 (it has the highest return in an expanding market). 
b. Maximin Project selected - 3 (it has the highest return in a diminishing market). 
c. Minimax Regret: Table of Regrets

Project selected - 1 
A minimax regret decision-maker would choose Project 1 as it has the lowest minimum regret. If Project 1 is selected, no matter the outcome, the decision-maker will never be more than $300 below the best outcome.

4.0 Introduction 
Sensitivity analysis and simulation provide alternatives to the methods used above to deal with risk and uncertainty in decision making. 

4.1 Sensitivity Analysis 
Sensitivity analysis calculates how responsive a decision is to changes in any of the variables used in making that decision. It looks at one variable at a time and measures how much the variable can change by (in percentage terms) before affecting the decision. The smaller the percentage, the more sensitive the decision is to that variable. Sensitivity % = Profit/Variable 
Note that the Variable in the formula above is an aggregated figure (e.g. revenue as a product of selling price and sales quantity). 

------
Quiz: Sensitivity Analysis 
The baker is considering launching a new type of small cake, the Esterhazy. The baker will not launch the Esterhazy if it will lose money in the first year. If it will break even or make a profit, the Esterhazy will be launched. An accountant has prepared a forecast profitability analysis for the Esterhazy, which shows that it will be profitable. The accountant's analysis is as follows: 
Selling price $ 3 
Variable costs $1.5 
Contribution per unit $1.5 
Budgeted sales per day $50 
Daily contribution $75 
Additional daily fixed costs $50
Additional daily profits $25 
Because the cake is forecast to make a profit, the baker has decided to launch it. The baker is worried, however, about how reliable the accountant's estimates are and wishes to know how sensitive his decision is to changes in the underlying estimates. 
Required: a. Calculate how sensitive the decision to launch the Esterhazy is to changes in: i. Selling price; ii. Volume of daily sales; and iii. Additional fixed costs. b. State to which of the variables in (a) the decision is most sensitive. 

Answer:
a. (i) Sensitivity to price 
Let p = price per unit. 
Contribution per unit = p - 1.5. 
At breakeven point, total contribution = total fixed costs 
Breakeven price (based on budgeted sales of 50 units per day): 
(p -1.5) * 50 = 50 
50p - 75=50 
50p = 125 
p = 2.50 
If the price is below 2.5, then a loss will be made. Price must fall 16.67% (0.5/3) to change the decision. 
a. (ii) Sensitivity to volume of daily sales 
Let v = daily sales in units 
Total contribution = 1.5 
At breakeven, $1.5 v = 50 
v = 33.33 
Forecast volume = 50 units per day 
Volume must fall 33.34% (16.67/50) to change the decision. 
a. (iii) Sensitivity to additional fixed costs 
The budgeted contribution per day is 75. 
The forecast fixed cost is 50. 
Fixed costs must rise 50% (25/50) over the forecast in order to change the decision. 
b. State to which of the variables in (a) the decision is most sensitive. 
The forecast is most sensitive to the change in price. This is the variable where the lowest change would result in the decision changing. 
Advantages:
· It gives an idea of how sensitive the decision taken is to changes in any of the original estimates.
· It can be readily adapted for use in spreadsheet packages.
Limitations: 
· Sensitivity is usually only used to examine what happens when one variable changes and others remain constant. 
· Without appropriate software, it can be time consuming.

4.2 Simulation 
Simulation - a mathematical model constructed to represent the operation of a real-life process or situation. 
Simulation is a technique which allows more than one variable to change at the same time. Most real-life problems are complex as there is more than one uncertain variable. Models can be generated which "simulate" the real-world environment within which the decision must be made. 

Example of Simulation
A computer model could simulate the conditions which exist for a baker. Each time the simulation is run (each trial), the model would randomly generate a selling price per unit, daily demand and daily fixed cost. The profit for the trial would then be calculated. The simulation would be run many times. Based on the results of the simulation, a probability distribution of the daily profit of the baker could be constructed. 

Although a simulation is not likely to be used in such a simple situation (as alternative models are available), it may be the only suitable method of analysing more complex situations where there are many variables which could change. One example of a mathematical model used in simulation is the "Monte Carlo" method. 

4.2.1 Stages 1. Specify the major variables (excessive detail will over-complicate). 2. Specify the relationship between the variables. 3. Attach probability distributions to each variable and assign random numbers to reflect the distribution. 4. Simulate the environment by generating random numbers. 5. Record the outcome of each simulation. 6. Repeat each simulation many times to obtain a probability distribution of the likely outcomes. 

4.2.2 Advantages and Limitations 
Advantages:
· It overcomes the limitations of sensitivity analysis by examining the effects of all possible combinations of variables and their realisations.
· It therefore provides more information about the possible outcomes and their relative probabilities.
· It is useful for problems which cannot be solved analytically by other means.
Limitations:
· It is not a technique for making a decision, only for getting more information about the possible outcomes. 
· It can be very time consuming without a computer. 
· It could prove expensive in designing and running the simulation on a computer. 
· It relies on reliable estimates of the probability distributions of the underlying variables.

5.1 Focus Groups 
Much of the uncertainty which companies face in the real world relates to new products and whether they will be successful. To reduce this uncertainty, focus groups may be used before the launch of a product. 
· A group of people are asked to give their opinion about a new product or service. The discussion occurs in an interactive environment where participants can share and discuss their views with other group members. 
· Members of the group are chosen at random. Often, they are approached by employees of the marketing organisation in the street and asked to participate. 
· Before the meeting, the group members may be screened to ensure they belong to the target market to which the product is aimed. 
· A moderator may be present to ease the discussion. 
· During the meeting, the participants may be observed, usually without their knowledge, by marketing professionals who examine their body language, facial expressions and group behaviour. 

5.2 Market Research 
Market research is the systematic gathering of information about customers, competitors and the market. The type of information collected in market research seeks to answer the following types of question:
· Who are the customers? 
· Where are they located? 
· What quantity and quality do they want? 
· What is the best time to sell? 
· What is the long-term price?
· Who are the competitors? 
Market research can be used to help companies make decisions about the development and marketing of new products. The earlier the market research is conducted in the development of a product, the better, from a risk point of view. Market research can be based on primary or secondary data. 
· Primary data means the company collects its own original data, for example, by conducting interviews. 
· Secondary data means that already published data is used, such as published statistics. 


Summary:
· The difference between risk and uncertainty is that risk is measured in terms of probability.
· Expected value is an average outcome based on probabilities. It is not suitable for one-off decisions. It is the decision rule for anyone who is risk-neutral.
· A profit table (payoff matrix) shows all possible payoffs which may result from the strategy chosen by the decision-maker.
· The value of perfect information is the maximum amount a business would be prepared to pay for an accurate forecast of the uncertain variables it faces. It is defined as: EV with perfect information (the forecast) less EV without perfect information
· Imperfect information has value if it results in a higher expected return than the expected value without it.
· Decision trees are a technique to visualise multi-stage decisions with various potential outcomes at each stage.
· A payoff table can be used to apply decision rules: Maximax selects the option with the highest potential outcome. Maximax is the decision rule for risk seekers; Maximin selects the best outcome of the worst case scenarios. Maximin is a decision rule for the risk averse.
· To apply the minimax regret rule also requires a table of regrets.
· Sensitivity analysis calculates how responsive a decision is to changes in any of the variables used to calculate it.
· Simulation allows for more than one variable to change at a time.
· In the real world, much of the risk that commercial organisations face comes from new products. Such risk can be reduced by focus groups or other forms of market research.


Chapter 9: Budgetary Systems and Types of Budget
This chapter covers the following Learning Outcomes. D. Budgeting and Control 1. Budgetary systems and types of budget a) Explain how budgetary systems fit within the performance hierarchy. b) Select and explain appropriate budgetary systems for an organisation, including top-down, bottom-up, rolling, zero-based, activity-based, incremental and feed-forward control. c) Describe the information used in budget systems and the sources of the information needed. d) Indicate the usefulness and problems with different budget types (including fixed, flexible, zero-based, activity-based, incremental, rolling, top-down, bottom-up, master, functional). e) Prepare flexed budgets, rolling budgets and activity-based budgets. f) Explain the beyond budgeting model, including the benefits and problems that may be faced if it is adopted in an organisation. g) Discuss the issues surrounding setting the difficulty level for a budget. h) Explain the benefits and difficulties of the participation of employees in the negotiation of targets. i) Explain the difficulties of changing a budgetary system or type of budget used. j) Explain how budget systems can deal with uncertainty in the environment. k) Discuss ethical and sustainability considerations when setting budgets. 7. Performance analysis c) Identify the factors which influence behaviour. 

1.1 Introduction A budgetary control system is a way of achieving financial control of an entity. The typical budgetary control system consists of the following stages: 1. A budget is prepared for a calendar year. This shows budgeted revenues, costs and possibly cash flows and statements of financial position. Normally, the budgets are divided into monthly periods. 2. Shortly after the end of each month, when the accounts for that month have been prepared, the actual results are compared with the budgeted results. Any differences (variances) between the actual results and budgeted amounts are investigated. 3. Action may be taken to prevent or correct undesirable variances (Note that some variances are unavoidable or uncontrollable; it would be difficult to take effective action on these) 

1.2 Objectives The objectives of a budgetary control system may be easily remembered with the mnemonic CRUMPET. 
1.2.1 Coordination One of the main objectives of a budgetary system of control is to coordinate the different activities of an organisation. This should help achieve goal congruence and is particularly important in decentralised organisations. Without a budget, the production department may not plan sufficient resources to meet the sales planned by the selling department. 

1.2.2 Responsibility A budget is a way of delegating responsibility by showing managers which revenues and costs they are responsible for. 

1.2.3 Utilisation Having a budget should lead to better resource utilisation. Decisions such as ordering inventory and hiring staff will be guided by the budget, meaning that organisations do not acquire resources in excess of their needs. 

1.2.4 Motivation Research shows that giving managers a target in the form of a budget may improve their performance compared with giving them no target. If the target becomes too difficult, however, it can demotivate managers. 

1.2.5 Planning Budgets are a financial plan. Requiring managers to prepare budgets forces them to think about the budget period. It makes them consider market conditions and how they will respond to them. This should lead to better decision-making than simply taking each day as it comes. Budgets cover a short-term time frame, typically one year. Most organisations have a long-term plan as well. The budget should be consistent with the long-term plan as it shows, in detail, how the budgeted period will contribute to the longer-term objectives. 

1.2.6 Evaluation Managers' performance is likely to be evaluated, at least partly, by how they perform against the budget they are given. In some organisations, managers may receive bonuses based on their performance relative to the budget. Promotions may also depend on this. In such situations, managers will be extremely keen to achieve the budget. 

1.2.7 Telling Budgets are a means by which superiors communicate their expectations of the managers below them. 

1.3 Ethical and Sustainability Considerations 
Traditionally, budgets have been set using a financial principal budget factor, focusing on economic aspects only. With business sustainability becoming more prevalent among investor demands and the need to manage ethical and sustainability risks and opportunities, the budget-setting process must incorporate ethical and sustainability elements to ensure its continued viability as an essential planning and performance management tool. 

1.3.1 Application of Sustainability and Ethical Budgeting Sustainable budgeting is primarily focused in the public sector (such as through the Paris Collaborative on Green Budgeting). However, there is increasing adoption among commercial firms as investors demand greater transparency and accountability of their activities towards the external environment. The primary focus is to have clearer information and goals on how budgeting decisions affect sustainability and societal well-being measures, such as the impact on climate and local community, pollution, CO2 emissions, etc. Performance information related to the budget can reflect additional measures, such as those on the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), in addition to traditional financial indicators. The budgets that should incorporate these measures range from asset expenditure budgets to planning for operational activities. The focus should not be on the budget itself but on the objectives of the budgetary process and the system, processes and controls that identify and measure achievement in these sustainability and ethical concerns. Likely, the organisation's budgetary processes are not as well-equipped to capture and report non-financial information as they are for economic indicators; investment and commitment would be needed to ensure appropriate investment in these information systems. One issue is the multiple aspects of ethics and sustainability, as opposed to the single reporting measure (currency) of financial budgeting. Budget setters need to identify the suitable measures relevant to their activities that are measurable and actionable within their available resources. For example, calculating the shareholder value in an operating activity or asset expenditure investment is done through various methods, such as discounted cash flow. However, this method ignores sustainability considerations entirely and does not reflect the other capitals besides the money needed to create value. There is also the assumption that investment in sustainable reporting technologies provides lower returns than alternatives and gains in other sustainable inputs (capitals) will not be well-received or valued by shareholders. Nevertheless, as there is increasing regulatory and investor sentiment on the sustainability of company operations, the viability of investment in the necessary methodologies to undertake sustainable budgeting will be increasingly attractive. 

2.1 Long-Term Planning 
A budget typically covers 12 months. Many organisations prepare longer-term plans. This section examines how the budgeting process fits the performance hierarchy. The first stage of long-term planning involves setting out the long-term, strategic objectives of the organisation (also called "corporate objectives" for a company). These objectives are often set out using a hierarchical structure, the performance hierarchy. A typical hierarchy of objectives is as follows: 
MISSION -> STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES -> BUSINESS UNIT -> OBJECTIVES 

2.2 Mission 
An organisation's mission can be described as the reason for the organisation's existence. A typical mission statement may include the following items: 
· Reason why the entity exists; 
· Type of business - the products and services offered; 
· Policies and standards of behaviour; 
· Values and culture. Although most commercial organisations aim to maximise shareholders' wealth, a mission is usually stated in terms of the goal that generates that wealth. 

2.3 Strategic Objectives 
Whether an organisation is achieving its mission is often a matter of opinion, as it is not usually set out in quantifiable terms. Strategic objectives are more concrete and state what the organisation must do to achieve its mission. Strategic objectives are specific and quantifiable. Examples of strategic objectives for a company might be: 
· To increase revenues by 10% per year. 
· To increase dividends by 5% per year. 
· To reduce global emissions of carbon gasses by 10% by 2030. 

2.4 Unit Objectives Once objectives are set for the organisation, they may be set for each business unit. These should be consistent with the strategic objectives. 

2.5 Setting Strategies 
Having established the organisation's objectives, possibly using the performance hierarchy approach, organisations need to determine what actions to take to achieve those objectives. These strategies may be set out in a long-term plan. 

2.6 Role of Budgeting in Long-Term Planning A budget is concerned with implementing the long-term plan for the budget period. The budget will be more detailed than the long-term plan, showing how the budget period will contribute to the long-term plan. 

2.7 Master Budget 
The master budget consolidates all other budgets. It is generally presented as a statement of profit or loss, a statement of financial position and a cash flow statement. Board approval of the master budget is part of the board's overall supervision of the business and its implementation of strategic goals. It helps ensure that the board ultimately has control over operations and expenditures. If the master budget is not approved, it will be returned to those responsible for preparing it. They will have to decide, in consultation with all those responsible at operational level for subsidiary budgets, where changes need to be made. This may be a time-consuming and challenging process as managers at the operational level may wish to avoid their budgets being cut. Other problems with the master budget include: 
· A problem with any of the subsidiary budgets may have significant effects on the master budget. 
· Even a minor amendment of the master budget may be complicated as it has to be processed through to the subsidiary budgets. 

2.8 Functional Budgets Operational managers will be responsible for carrying out (and preparing if "bottom-up" budgeting is used - see s.3.2) functional budgets. Primary functional budgets include sales, production, materials, labour and capital. The primary budgets may be consolidations from individual cost centres (Chapter 2), profit centres or investment centres. 
Profit centre - a business segment where revenues are received and expenditures incurred. 
Investment centre - a profit centre which also has some control over its capital expenditure (investment in assets).
The preparation of functional budgets must be done in sequence, starting with identifying the principal budgeting factor (the main limiting factor), which is often sales demand. The sales, finished goods and production budgets may then be prepared, followed by the budgets for production resources and the overhead and cash budgets. This process means that data from one budget may be input for another. The individual functional budgets must be reviewed with each other to ensure they are consistent. A change in one budget (e.g. sales price and quantity) may require adjusting all the other budgets, which may be time-consuming. 

3.1 Introduction 
A number of different approaches to the preparation of budgets have evolved. It is important to understand these approaches and appreciate which would be appropriate for different types of organisations. The methods mentioned in the ACCA Study Guide are as follows: 
· Top-down and bottom-up (s.3.2); 
· Rolling budgets (s.3.3); 
· Zero-based budgeting (s.3.4); 
· Activity-based budgeting (s.3.5); 
· Incremental (s.3.6); and 
· Feed-forward control (s.3.7). 

3.2 Top-Down v Bottom-Up Budgeting 
An important factor in budgeting is how much participation managers enjoy in preparing their budgets. In some organisations, budgets are prepared centrally by the finance department, with the input of senior management. These budgets are then imposed on junior managers, who are expected to work towards operating their departments within budget. Other organisations allow a more participative approach. The managers of each department prepare the first draft of their budget, which is then discussed with senior managers. After some negotiation, changes may be made to the draft to ensure that the final budget meets the objectives of the whole organisation before it is approved. 

Top-down budgeting - budgets are prepared by senior management. 
Bottom-up (participative) budgeting - managers participate in preparing their department's budget. 

In reality, the decision is not between choosing top-down or bottom-up, but deciding how much participation managers of responsibility centres should have in preparing their budgets. There are many different degrees of participation, for example: 
· Managers prepare their own budgets or plans without senior management's intervention. 
· Managers prepare the first draft, which senior managers then amend. 
· Senior managers prepare the budgets after discussion with the managers responsible. 
· Senior managers prepare the budget entirely, and the departmental managers have no input. 

3.2.1 Factors to Consider 
The following factors may be considered in deciding how much participation should be allowed: 
· The attitudes of junior managers to their work. Some may be very proactive and want to participate in managing their department. If they are not allowed to participate, they will become disappointed and demotivated. Others may be less proactive and require detailed guidance from above (i.e. a top-down approach may be more appropriate). 
· The skills of junior managers relating to budgeting. If their financial skills are weak, their participation may be limited. 
· The amount of interdependence between departments. If departments rely on each other (e.g. services of one department are consumed by another), then more coordination of the budgeting process will be necessary. This will require some intervention by senior management. 
· In periods of financial difficulty, when control of the resources and cash flows of the organisation is essential for survival, senior management should intervene. 
· The amount of "local" knowledge of senior managers. In huge organisations, senior head-office management may have little understanding of local conditions "on the ground" (i.e. in the divisions or branches). In this case, local managers' participation in preparing their budgets is advisable. 
The culture of the organisation is also a significant factor: 
· In a "command and control" approach to management, everything is centrally planned, and all junior staff are told what they must do. Top-down budgeting is often a feature of such organisations. 
· Other organisations may adopt a more delegated approach, giving managers autonomy. They will be given broad guidelines about what is expected but allowed to do the detailed planning without central intervention. Such organisations are more likely to adopt a participative approach. 

3.2.2 Participation and the Objectives of Budgeting 
Participation in the budget preparation process may help or hinder the objectives of budgeting: 
· Planning: Budgets force managers to take time away from managing day-to-day operations to plan the future of their departments. The more involvement junior managers and staff have in the budgeting process, the more they will be forced to plan. 
· Coordination: Coordination of the various departments in budgeting is easier if budgeting is performed centrally and there is less participation. 
· Motivation: Managers are more likely to be motivated if they are involved in setting their budgets. Managers given responsibility for a department but not allowed to participate in their budgets may become demotivated. 
· Evaluation of performance: If managers are evaluated on their performance against the budget, the budget must be set at an appropriate difficulty level. It should be challenging but realistic. If managers participate in preparing their budgets, there is a risk of budgetary slack.  
Budgetary slack - is the intentional underestimation of budgeted revenues or overestimation of budgeted costs to make budgets easier to achieve. 

3.2.3 Advantages and Disadvantages 

----
Quiz: Advantages
Suggest FOUR advantages of top-down budgeting and FOUR advantages of bottom-up budgeting

Answer:
Top-Down Budgeting 
· Senior management have greater control of the budgetary process. The budgets will, therefore, reflect more accurately the corporate objectives and the long-term plan. 
· Where managers prepare their own budgets, and are assessed on how they perform relative to these, there is a temptation for the managers to add "budgetary slack" (i.e. they overstate budgeted expenses or understate budgeted revenues to make their budgets easier to achieve). Using top-down budgeting avoids this risk. 
· Since budgets are prepared centrally, the activities of the various departments should be better coordinated 
· It may be difficult for managers with little financial or accounting knowledge to prepare budgets for their own departments. Top-down budgeting means that these managers would not have to prepare their own budgets. 
· The various budgets are more likely to be set at the same level of difficulty and would, therefore, be fairer than if bottom-up budgeting is used. 
Bottom-Up Budgeting 
· Managers are more likely to accept the budgeted targets for their departments and work towards achieving them if they have been involved in setting the budgets. 
· Managers have a more detailed knowledge of the work which their departments do than senior management and, therefore, can produce more realistic budgets. 
· Managers may feel more motivated if they are given greater autonomy and more responsibility for their departments. Giving managers greater autonomy would normally include giving them the right to participate in preparing their own budgets. 
· At the end of the budget period, when managers' performance is being assessed, the managers cannot claim that the budget was unrealistic if they prepare the budget. 
· Managers will better understand the financial objectives of the organisation if they are involved in budgeting. The budget process can therefore be regarded as a form of training to non- financial managers.

3.3 Rolling Budgets (Rolling Forecasts) 
Rolling budget - a system of budgeting in which the budget is continuously updated. 
In a rolling budget, the budget horizon (typically one year) is kept constant by adding another month (or quarter) to the end of the budgeted period as each month (or quarter) expires. 

Example of Rolling Budgets 
A budget is prepared for the year 20X2. At the end of January 20X2, the actual performance for January is compared against the budget. Based on this comparison, it may be decided that the budgets for 1 February to 31 December 20X2 should be changed to reflect changes in external factors. Once this has been done, a budget is also prepared for January 20X3. The new budget, therefore, covers 1 February 20X2 to 31 January 20X3. 

3.3.1 Usefulness of Rolling Budgets 
· The budget is continuously updated to reflect external changes, making it more relevant and valid for comparison against actual performance. 
· There will always be a budget for the next 12 months. This can be useful for planning things such as cash flows. 
· Managers will be more motivated as the budget is more realistic because it will be updated to take account of changes outside of their control. 

3.3.2 Problems with Rolling Budgets 
· The process is more time consuming as budgets have to be regularly updated and is also, therefore, more costly. 
· Budgets may be changed to hide operational inefficiencies. 

3.3.3 Appropriateness of Rolling Budgets 
Rolling budgets are likely to be more appropriate in industries which are dynamic, where external changes can lead to the original budget quickly becoming out of date. In stable industries, little benefit may be obtained by continuously updating the budget, making a rolling budget less useful.

Quiz: Rolling Budgets 
For organisations in each of the following industries, discuss whether rolling budgets would be appropriate: 
· A food retailer 
· A developer of handheld computer devices and mobile phones 
· An airline 
· An advertising agency 
· A retail bank  

Answer:
Food Retailer: 
Food retailing is a stable business. Few unexpected external changes are likely to occur. Therefore, little benefit would be gained by continuously updating budgets, so rolling budgets are unlikely to be used. 
Manufacturer of Mobile Computer Devices and Mobile Phones: 
This industry is very dynamic as new products are constantly being developed. As competitors introduce new products, this may well change demand for the companies' own products. It also may affect whether existing development projects are accelerated, scrapped or changed. Accordingly, rolling budgets may be useful in this type of business. 
Airlines:
Airlines are also subject to many external factors. Fuel typically accounts for 50% of the total costs of many airlines, so changes in the market price of oil will affect profits. Economic factors heavily affect demand, because travel is a "discretionary" activity for many people. Accordingly, rolling budgets may be useful, as otherwise budgets quickly could become out of date. 
Advertising Agencies:
Budgeting is likely to be very difficult in advertising agencies. Revenues may vary significantly from month to month depending on whether clients decide to spend on campaigns. Accordingly, rolling forecasts could be useful. 
Retail Banking:
As retail banking is a fairly stable business, there is little benefit may be gained from using rolling budgets.

Example of Rolling Budgets 
Computation Company A has computed a 2-quarter rolling budget for the costs of one of its outlets: 
| Quarter   | 1     | 2     |
|           | $     | S     |
| Rental    | 4000  | 4000  |
| Labour    | 3000  | 3000  |
| Materials | 4000  | 4000  |
| Overheads | 1000  | 1000  |
| Total     | 12000 | 12000 |
The following events have occurred: 
1. The landlord has raised the rental from Quarter 3 onwards by 10%, and Company A has accepted the revised rental agreement. 
2. A new labour regulation has increased the minimum wage by $100 monthly for workers earning minimum wage from Quarter 2 onwards. This outlet has 3 of these workers. 
3. The company has managed to secure a new materials supply that is 15% cheaper than previously. The outlet will receive this new supply in Quarter 3. The quantity of production and sales is the same for all three quarters. 
At the end of Quarter 1, Company A will roll the budget into a new 2-quarter period (Quarter 3 and 4), with adjustments as shown: 
| Quarter   | 1 (ended) | 2 (adjusted) | 3 (new)     |
|           | S         | S            | S           |
| Rental    | 4000      | 4000         | 4400 (+10%) |
| Labour    | 3000      | 3900 (+900)  | 3900        |
| Materials | 4000      | 4000         | 3400 (+15%) |
| Overheads | 4000      | 1000         | 1000        |
| Total     | 12000     | 12900        | 12700       |

Quiz: Rolling Budgets 
Homeland Airways uses rolling forecasts. At the start of the year, the following quarterly budget was prepared:
|         | Quarter 1  | Quarter 2 | Quarter 3 | Quarter 4 |
|         | $m         | $m        | $m        | $m	   |
| Revenue | 200        | 230       | 400       | 170       |
| Costs:  |            |           |           |           |
| Fuel    | 70         | 81        | 120       | 60        |
| Labour  | 60         | 65        | 70        | 60        |
| Other   | 20         | 23        | 40        | 17        |
| Profit  | 50         | 61        | 170       | 33        |
It is now the end of Quarter 1, and the company wishes to update the budget as follows: 
1. Due to a rise in the world price of oil, budgeted fuel costs for Quarters 2, 3 and 4 should increase to 120% of the amount shown in the original budget. 
2. The original budget was based on the assumption that an increase in staff costs of 10% would be negotiated with the unions. In that event, a pay rise of only 5% was agreed. 
3. There is no change in budgeted revenues or other costs. 
4. Quarter 1 of the following year should be based on the assumption that all items are 10% higher than budgeted for Quarter 1 of the current year, except fuel, which should be 44% higher. 
Required: Prepare the rolling budget for the four quarters starting with Quarter 2 of the current year. 

Answer:
|         | Quarter 2 | Quarter 3 | Quarter 4 | Quarter 1 |
|         | $m        | $m        | $m        | $m        |
| Revenue | 230       | 400       | 170       | 220       |
| Costs:  |           |           |           |           |
|   Fuel  | 97        | 144       | 72        | 101       |
|   Labour| 62        | 67        | 57        | 66        |

| Profit  | 48        | 149       | 24        | 31        |
Notes: 
1. Fuel for Q2 to Q4 is the original budget amount multiplied by 1.2. 
2. Staff costs are calculated by multiplying the original budget amounts by 110

3.4 Incremental Budgeting 
3.4.1 Use of Historical Data An incremental budget is prepared based on the previous period's budget or actual performance, with incremental amounts added for the new budget period. These increments will include adjustments for inflation and planned increases in sales prices and costs. As the allocation of resources is based on the previous period's figures, it is not generally recommended as it fails to consider changing circumstances. Also, it encourages a "spend it or lose" mentality, as spending the budget is likely to ensure a reasonable allocation in the next period. 

Example of Incremental Budgeting in a School 
A school has budgeted $1.5 million for staff salaries this year. When preparing the budget for the next year, the head teacher estimates: 
· Two new members of staff will be needed to teach languages, with a salary of $30,000 each (before any pay rises); 
· All staff members will be awarded a pay increase of 5% in line with inflation. 
The budget for staff will then be $1.638 million [($1.5m + $30k + $30k) * 1.05], an overall increase of 9.2%. 
Although this approach is quick and easy, it accepts without questioning the $1.5 million salaries included in the calculation; it does not challenge the starting point. 

3.4.2 Usefulness of Incremental Budgeting 
· This approach may be appropriate for a stable business with good cost control. 
· Managers need only justify the increments. 
· The system is relatively simple to operate and easy to understand. 
· Conflicts should be avoided if departments can be seen to be treated similarly. 
· Coordination between budgets is easier to achieve, as increments in functional budgets are easily aggregated into master budgets. 
· The effect of change can be seen quickly. 

3.4.3 Problems with Incremental Budgeting 
· Assumes activities and methods of working will continue in the same way regardless of whether they are needed. 
· It gives no incentive for developing new ways of working (e.g. to increase efficiency) or the reduction of costs. 
· It encourages a "spend it or lose" mentality so that the budget is maintained next year. 
· The budget may become out of date and no longer relate to the level of activity or type of work being carried out. 
· The priority for resources may have changed since the budgets were set originally. 
· Any budgetary slack in a previous budget is not reviewed. It is also easier to add and justify budgetary slack to make achieving budgets easier. 
· When a budgeting system has been in operation for some time, there is a tendency for the following year's budget to be justified by referencing the levels currently being achieved. However, the analysis process should consider all changes affecting the organisation's future activities. 
· Even using such an analytical base, some organisations find that historical comparisons, particularly the current resource constraints, can inhibit innovative budget changes. This can severely handicap an organisation because the budget should be the first year of the long-term strategic plan. If changes are not started in the budget period, it will be more difficult for the organisation to make the progress necessary to achieve long-term objectives. 

3.5 Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) 
3.5.1 Weakness of Incremental Budgeting One way of breaking out of the cyclical budgeting problems associated with incremental budgeting is to go back to basics and develop the budget from an assumption of no existing resources (i.e. a "zero base"). Using this basis, all resources must be justified, and the chosen way of achieving any specified objectives must be compared with the alternatives. For example, in considering budgeted sales, an optimum means of achieving the sales objectives in a particular market for a specific product or service may be developed without considering the costs and structure of the current sales department. The company must then plan how to implement this new strategy. 

3.5.2 Features of ZBB Traditional budgets are typically produced using a "line item" approach, which lists each type of expense (e.g. staff costs, depreciation, etc.) and the amount budgeted by each department. ZBB focuses on the activities or programmes each department would like to undertake. It considers questions such as: 
· Is the activity necessary? 
· What happens if the activity ceases? 
· Is the current level of provision adequate? 
· What other ways are there of carrying out the activity? 
· How much should the activity cost? 
· Do the benefits gained from the activity at least match the costs? 
These questions are primarily answered by breaking the budgetary process down into the three distinct stages of the ZBB approach: 1. Each manager identifies activities or programmes to undertake in the budgeted period. A "decision package" (like a "mini-budget") is then prepared for each activity that analyses how much will need to be spent. There also may be some narrative explaining the benefits of the package and quantifying any revenues (or cost savings) if appropriate. 2. A budget committee reviews and ranks all the decision packages (in decreasing order of benefits). Management accepts each package up to the point at which the total budgeted expenditure is reached. 3. Resources are allocated to the activities selected in Step 2. The budget is then a consolidation of all the accepted packages. 

3.5.3 Decision Package 
A decision package is produced for each activity the managers wish to undertake in the following year. For example, a large accountancy firm's decision package might relate to "ACCA training". A package may be broken down into: 
· a "base level" package specifying the minimum level of service that would be required; and 
· Incremental packages with additional expenditure. 
A base package for ACCA training might include exam registration and study materials. An incremental package could include training courses. Then, when ranking packages, the budget committee can decide whether to accept just the base package or provide additional funds for the incremental package. Decision packages also may be mutually exclusive (i.e. two or more packages are alternative approaches to the same problem). For example, one package may be for making a component in-house and another for outsourcing. It would not make sense for the budget committee to select both packages. 

3.5.4 Benefits of ZBB 
The benefits of ZBB are substantial. (They have to be; otherwise, no organisation would implement it.) 
· It forces budget setters to re-evaluate every activity. Obsolete activities are removed. Wastage and budget slack should be eliminated. 
· Allocation of resources is linked to results and needs. 
· It develops a questioning attitude and encourages managers to look for alternatives. 
· It encourages a bottom-up approach to budgeting. This should boost the motivation of employees. 
· It prevents "budget creep" (based on previous year's figures with a percentage add-on) associated with other budgeting techniques. 

3.5.5 Drawbacks of ZBB 
· Departmental managers may not have the necessary skills to construct decision packages. They will need training, which requires time and money. 
· In a large organisation, the number of activities will be so large that the amount of paperwork generated from ZBB will be unmanageable. 
· Ranking the packages can be difficult since many activities cannot be compared based purely on quantitative measures. Qualitative factors need to be incorporated, but this is difficult. 
· Top-level management may not have the time or knowledge to rank thousands of packages. This problem can be partly overcome by having each manager level rank the packages of the managers who report to them. 
· It is a complex and time-consuming process. Therefore, the complete process may be carried out only every five years (say). An alternative approach is to look in-depth at one area of the business each year on a rolling basis so that each area prepares a ZBB every five years. 
· Since decisions are made at budget time, managers may feel unable to react to changes during the year. This could harm the business if it fails to respond to emerging opportunities and threats. 
· The organisation's management information systems might be unable to provide the necessary information. 
· As the budgeting cycle is annual, short-term goals may be prioritised instead of long-term objectives. 

3.5.6 When ZBB Is Appropriate 
Discretionary cost - a capital or revenue expense that can be curtailed, eliminated or postponed without affecting short-term profitability. 
ZBB is most appropriate in organisations that have a high portion of discretionary costs (e.g. research and development, training and advertising). Expenditure on such items may be reduced without the organisation ceasing to function; however, such expenditure does bring benefits. ZBB enables organisations to reassess how much they spend on such discretionary items. Organisations with relatively low discretionary expenditure would not gain as much from introducing ZBB. 

3.5.7 Use of ZBB in the Public Sector The use of ZBB is more prevalent in public sector bodies due to the following factors: 
· Showing a budget based on activities rather than line items is more transparent. A budget that shows the total amount spent on employee costs does not provide useful information to taxpayers. However, if the budget shows the amount to be spent building a new motorway, taxpayers can appreciate where their taxes are being spent. 
· The ranking of decision packages can be beneficial in allocating limited public sector resources, where governments face demands for funds from numerous programmes. Ranking helps ensure that taxpayers' money is spent where it will best meet the government's objectives. 
· A large proportion of expenditure, but not all, will be discretionary. This means that a mixed approach might be taken to budgeting, where some allocations will be budgeted using an incremental approach and some using a ZBB approach. 

Example of ZBB in a School 
As part of preparing its annual budgets, a school needs to decide how it will provide for or facilitate school lunches. The school's catering manager considers three options: 
Option 1: Provide an area where pupils can eat their own packed lunches, with the school also offering sandwiches and other food and drinks, prepared and sold by catering staff. 
Option 2: Provide a self-service cafeteria with hot and cold food and drinks available. 
Option 3: Provide a complete, hot food, catered service. 
The base level of service would be option 1, with options 2 and 3 the higher level service options. Alternatively, the school may consider two mutually exclusive decision packages: 
1. Provide a service internally; or 
2. Outsource the whole catering activity to an external provider. 
The catering manager may produce a cost-benefit analysis at this stage to establish the costs and benefits of different options and packages. The ultimate decision is likely to rest with the headteacher and/or the school finance officer, the person who has budgetary responsibility for the whole school. This person will consider the catering budget alongside other school budgets. 

3.6 Activity-Based Budgeting (ABB) 
3.6.1 Principles of ABB 
Most budgeting techniques assume that costs vary with the level of output. However, the costs of support activities do not necessarily depend on the number of units produced or sold (see Chapter 2). For these types of costs, a more sophisticated budgeting approach is appropriate. Activity-based budgeting (ABB) follows activity-based costing (ABC) principles, identifying cost drivers to determine budgeted costs. Having decided how many units to produce and sell, the organisation needs to define the cost of the required activities. These depend on the drivers identified for each activity. 

3.6.2 Preparation of AB Budgets Preparing activity-based budgets is rather like performing ABC in reverse. The following steps are used: 1. Estimate the budgeted volume of sales and production in units. 2. For each activity (e.g., machine set-up), estimate the number of driver units required to support the budgeted sales and production volume (e.g., the number of production runs). 3. Determine the cost of each unit of driver. This may require an analysis of factors such as labour time required, labour cost per unit, etc. 4. Calculate the budgeted cost of each activity (number of drivers * cost per unit of driver).

Quiz: Activity-Based Budgeting ABC Co produces food for farm animals. It makes three ranges of food: poultry, cattle and sheep. The food is produced and sold in metric tonnes to agricultural wholesalers. The company is preparing its budgets for the next financial year and wishes to use an activity-based approach to budgeting for its overheads. Direct costs per tonne are as follows: 
|                   | Poultry | Cattle | Sheep |
| Materials         | $500    | $700   | $850  |
| Labour cost       | $120    | $140   | $800  |
| Weekly production | 1,000   | 750    | 900   |
The company uses ABC and has identified the following support activities for which overhead costs are incurred: 
| Activity           | Driver                    |
| Machine set-ups    | Number of production runs |
| Ordering materials | Number of orders          |
| Storage            | Tonne days of storage     |
The expected number of drivers that will be used each week by each of the three products is shown as follows: 
|                       | Poultry | Cattle | Sheep |
| Production runs       | 8       | 15     | 9     |
| Purchase orders       | 20      | 25     | 30    |
| Tonne days of storage | 14      | 18     | 36    |
The management accountant has already calculated the cost per unit of driver for the machine set-ups and storage as follows: Cost per unit of driver $500 per production run $10 per tonne day Hide 
| Activity        | Cost per unit of driver |
| Machine set-ups | $500 per production run |
| Storage         | $10 per tonne day       |
Unfortunately, the management accountant quit at the end of the last month, and you have been asked to complete the budget. You have discovered the following information about the purchase order process: 
1. Each order takes 30 minutes to process (on average). The cost of employing clerical staff is $10 per hour. Clerical staff would work a minimum of 40 hours per week. 
2. Office supplies cost $180 per clerk per week. 
3. Each clerk would require a desktop computer. The cost of providing the computer is estimated at $20 per week. 

Required: a. Calculate the cost per purchase order based on the information provided. b. Prepare the weekly budgeted costs, showing the total budgeted cost of each activity separately. 

Answer:
a. Cost per purchase order 
|                                               | $     |

| Office supplies                               | 180   |
| Computer (one clerk)                          | 20    |
| Total weekly cost                             | 600   |
| Number of purchase orders                     | 75    |
| Cost per order                                | 8     |

b. Weekly budgeted costs 
|                                                          | $      | $         |
| Materials (500 * 1,000) + (700 * 750) + (850 * 900)      |        | 1,790,000 |
| Direct labour (120 * 1,000) + (140 * 750) + (800 * 900)  |        | 945,000   |
| Total direct costs                                       |        | 2,735,000 |
| Indirect costs:                                          |        |           |
| Machine set-ups (500 * (8 + 15 + 9))                     | 16,000 |           |
| Purchase orders (8 * (20 + 25 + 30))                     | 600    |           |
| Storage costs (10 * (14 + 18 + 36))                      | 680    |           |
| Total indirect costs                                     |        | 17,280    |

3.6.3 Advantages of ABB 
· Management attention is focused on the activities of the organisation. These are something that management can control more easily than focusing on total costs. 
· A better understanding of what causes costs to be incurred may provide opportunities for cost reductions. 
· May identify "non-value adding" activities which can be eliminated. 

3.6.4 Disadvantages of ABB 
· It is complicated and expensive to implement as it requires detailed analysis of overheads and measuring of activities. If direct costs are more significant than indirect costs and the product range is narrow, the costs of switching to ABB are likely to outweigh the benefits. 
· As many fixed costs do not vary with changes in the volume of drivers in the short run, ABB may provide misleading information.

 3.6.5 Appropriateness of ABB
ABB is a complex method. It will likely be used only in large companies with the resources to implement such an approach. It is most appropriate in these situations: 
· The organisation has high overheads. 
· There are many different activities (drivers) to which the overheads relate. 
· The organisation has many products with differing production times and methods. 
See Chapter 10 for an example of preparing an activity-based budget. 

3.7 Feedback and Feed-Forward Control 
3.7.1 Feedback Control A feedback control system is a system in which outputs are monitored against a predetermined standard. Action is taken to remedy any deviations. The feedback is the information concerning the difference between the actual output and the desired output. A budgetary control system is an example of a feedback control system. For each period, the actual results are compared against the budget. If the budget is not achieved, action can be taken to correct the factor that caused the budget to be missed. 

3.7.2 Closed-Loop System A closed-loop system is any system with feedback. Reliance on feedback makes such systems reactive rather than proactive. 
· Standard: What the system aims for (e.g. the budget). 
· Sensor: Measures the system's output (i.e. accumulation of actual data). 
· Comparator: Compares the information from the sensor to the standard (e.g. variance analysis). 
· Effector: Control action (e.g. management action to minimise future adverse variances and repeat favourable variances). 

3.7.3 Open-Loop System 
An open-loop system is a system without feedback. There are two reasons for the absence of feedback: 1. Feedback is not produced (e.g. variance analysis not undertaken). 2. Feedback is produced but not used appropriately (e.g. variances are not communicated to the appropriate manager)

3.7.4 Positive and Negative Feedback Positive feedback means that the output has achieved or even exceeded the plan. Negative feedback means the output is below the plan (e.g. actual profits are below budget for a particular period). The cause of negative feedback should be investigated so that corrective action can be taken to reduce the likelihood of repetition in the future. Positive results (e.g. favourable variances) should also be investigated to determine whether they can be repeated. However, care must be taken here (e.g. a favourable sales price variance might reduce profits if demand is sensitive to price changes). 

3.7.5 Feed-Forward Control 
The major problem with feedback control systems is that by the time the feedback is received, it is too late to take action to correct the deviation for the period under review. For example, if actual costs are higher than budgeted, action can be taken to stop the same deviation from occurring in future periods. The current period, however, is already history, and no action can be taken to change that. In feed-forward control systems, predicted future results are compared against the desired outcome. If it appears that the desired result will not be achieved based on the current prediction, action can be taken now so that it is achieved. 

Key Point 
Target costing (see Chapter 3) is an example of feed-forward control. The expected cost per unit is compared with the desired cost per unit, and action is taken to eliminate the gap. 

Example of Feed-Forward Control 
Alpha operates in a business not subject to seasonal variations in demand or costs. The company has budgeted to make a profit of $10 million for the current financial year, which ends on 31 December. On 30 June, profits for the year's first half are $4 million. Based on this, the directors forecast that profits for the year will be only $8 million, not $10 million unless some action is taken. Because this information is available halfway through the year, the directors can take action to remedy the situation to try to achieve the budgeted profit figure of $10 million for the year. The forecast profit of $8 million is, therefore, feed-forward. 

4.1 Aspects of Information Quality 
In considering the sources of information for use in budgetary systems, attention should be paid to aspects of the quality of information. These may be summarised as "ACCURATE". 
| Aspect          | Meaning                                                                      | Considerations                                                                    |
| Accurate        | Fair, free from bias, truthful, with sufficient focus and precision.         | Quality of source, level of detail, precision, quantitative accuracy, references. |
| Complete        | It contains all the necessary information, with no material details missing. | Details, coverage, references, scope.                                             |
| Cost- effective | The benefit of information is higher than the cost of producing it.          | Costs of obtaining, processing and communicating information.                     |
| User- focused   | Tailored to information users" needs.                                        | Format, templates, style, permissions, logical flow, level of detail.             |
| Relevant        | Information is useable for actions (control, decision-making)                | Source, context, user, timing.                                                    |
| Authoritative   | Trustworthiness of information                                               | Source, provenance, transparency, processing.                                     |
| Timeliness      | It is clear when the information was produced.                               | Date, time, possible obsolescence, and alternative sources available.             |
| Easy to use     | Easy to understand and prioritise                                            | Format, template, language, syntax, use of jargon, typology, graphics.            |

4.2 Sources of Data and Information 
Data and information come from multiple sources - both internal (inside the business) and external. Businesses need to capture and use information which is relevant and reliable. This was discussed in detail in Chapter 1. 
4.2.1 Internal Sources Accounting records are a primary source. They detail past transactions which may be used as the basis for planning (e.g. preparing a financial budget or forecast). They are primarily used to record what has happened to the financial resources of a business. For example, how cash has been obtained and spent, what assets Accounting records also provide non-financial information. For example, documented reasons for raising debit notes to suppliers or credit notes to customers can provide useful information about the quality of materials purchased/finished goods sold. Data analysed from sales invoices give a profile of which products, to whom and in which markets sales are being made. Much internal information is related to the accounting system but not a direct part of it. For example: 
· Employee records (personal details, wage rates or salary, skills and experience, training records); 
· Costings for tenders for contracts; 
· Production department data (e.g. number of machines, operating capacity, repairs and maintenance records); 
· Records of direct contact with customers (e.g. complaint letters, calls received by a customer service centre). 
Not all internal information is provided formally. For example, relevant and reliable information may be communicated through regular meetings without formal documentation. 

4.2.2 External Sources 
External sources provide information about how business activities must be undertaken. For example: 
· Businesses must keep records to collect taxes on behalf of the government, and so need regular and up- to-date information about the taxation system (e.g. VAT, corporate profits tax) and what actions need to be taken (e.g. returns submitted, payments made). 
· Businesses need to be aware of laws that affect their activities (e.g. environmental legislation, health and safety regulations, labour law). 
"Market" or "competitive intelligence" (i.e. information about the markets in which a business operates) may be obtained through market research. 

5.1 Traditional Approaches to Budgeting 
The traditional approach to budgeting uses an incremental approach. Changes to budgetary systems are likely to occur when organisations move away from traditional approaches to budgeting to more sophisticated methods (e.g. ZBB or ABB). 

5.2 Difficulties 
In changing the approach to budgeting, organisations are likely to encounter the following obstacles: 
· Resistance to change - employees who do not appreciate the value of change may be reluctant to help, especially if it requires additional work. 
· Scepticism - particularly at senior management levels. Managers who do not understand the benefit of the change may not give their full support. 
· Training everyone involved in the process of change. New methods will require an investment in training so that all those involved will be competent to perform the new types of budgets. 
· Additional time and costs involved in moving to a new system, including for consultants and staff overtime. 

6.1 Forecasting 
 budget is effectively a forecast of what can be achieved. The forecast has to make assumptions about the external environment. The following are some of the factors that may cause uncertainty in the budget-setting process: 
· The overall economic performance of the markets in which the business sells. Economic growth may lead to increased demand for products or services. 
· Actions of competitors. A competitor's launch of a great new product may reduce demand considerably. 
· Performance of employees. It may be difficult to estimate how productive employees will be and how many employees will actually be required. 
· Market prices of inputs. The prices of many commodities (e.g. metals and oil) are determined by highly developed international markets and can be very volatile. 
· Demand for new products will be uncertain. Popularity will not be known until the products have been launched. However, this uncertainty can be reduced through market research. 
The following methods can be used to deal with uncertainty: 
· Flexed or flexible budgets; 
· Rolling budgets; and 
· Revision of the budgets at the end of the period before comparing with actual results. 

6.2 Flexible Budgets 
Flexible budgeting involves preparing two or more budgets, using different assumptions for each about the level of sales or production. At the end of the financial period, the budget would be flexed to the actual activity level for comparison to actual performance. To prepare budgets at different activities levels requires an understanding of cost behaviour (i.e. fixed, variable and stepped). 
Total cost is expressed as a linear equation: Total cost = Fixed cost + (Variable cost x Activity level) 
Techniques that may be required to calculate costs include: 
· High-low method; and 
· Learning curve. (See Chapter 10 for quantitative analysis in budgeting.) 

6.2.1 Advantages of Flexible Budgets The requirement to prepare more than fixed budget means that: 
· Managers are required to consider a range of forecasts; 
· Actual results can be compared more meaningfully against the budget for the closest level of activity. 

6.2.2 Disadvantages of Flexible Budgets 
· Difficulty in separating fixed and variable elements of indirect costs (overheads). 
· Cost may not behave as assumed (e.g. linearly or as predicted by a learning curve). 

6.3 Flexed Budgets 
At the end of the year, prior to comparing the actual figures against the budget, the budgets are re- calculated (flexed) using the original budget assumptions, but the actual activity levels. This means that the comparison is more valid. Fixed costs may also be flexed if different activity levels result in changes to fixed costs (such as in the case of stepped fixed costs).

Quiz: Flexed Production Cost 
Corfe Co manufactures computer laptop batteries and it has developed a new battery which has a longer usage time than batteries currently available in laptops. The selling price of the battery is forecast to be $45. The maximum production capacity of Corfe Co's factory is 262,500 units. The management accountant has prepared an annual flexible budget as follows:

In addition to the above costs, the management accountant estimates that for each increment of 50,000 units produced, one supervisor will need to be employed. A supervisor's annual salary is $35,000. 
Required: Calculate the flexed total production cost for production at 80% of maximum capacity. 

Answer:
An 80% activity level is 210,000 units (80% * 262,500) which is closest to 200,000 of the levels budgeted. 
Material and labour are both variable costs. The unit variable costs are the same at all levels: 
Material is $4 per unit (e.g. $800,000/200,000) and labour is $5.50 per unit (e.g. $1.1m/200,000), so total variable cost per unit is $9.50.
Therefore:
|                                             | $000                |
| Total variable costs($9.50 * 210,000 units) | 1,995               |

7.1 Factors Which Influence Behaviour 
In many organisations, managers are at least partly evaluated on how they perform compared to the budget. The budget is, therefore, likely to influence the behaviour of those managers. The budget is hoped to motivate managers to achieve higher organisational profits. Several factors will affect this. 

7.2 Hopwood's Management Styles One of the first management writers to consider the effect of budgets on behaviour was Hopwood, who carried out a survey of budgeting practices during the 1970s to identify how budgets influenced the behaviour of managers. He identified three different management styles in the companies he visited: budget constrained, profit conscious and non-accounting. 

7.2.1 Budget-Constrained Style Managers are evaluated on their ability to meet budgets in the short term. Failure to meet budgets means that managers will have poor evaluations, even if there was a good reason for exceeding the budget. 

7.2.2 Profit-Conscious Style In the profit-conscious company, managers are judged more on their ability to contribute to long-term success rather than simply meeting the budget. Budgets are used, but are applied more flexibly. For example, if the budget was not reached, but there was a good reason for this, the manager would not be penalised. 

7.2.3 Non-accounting Style 
Accounting data is not important for performance evaluation. Qualitative factors are seen as more important (e.g. customer satisfaction). The following table summarises the effect of these styles on the behaviour of managers: 
|                                             | Budget- constrained | Profit- conscious | Non- accounting |  
| Involvement with costs                      | High                | High              | Low             |
| Job-related tension                         | High                | Medium            | Medium          |
| Manipulation of data                        | Extensive           | Little            | Little          |
| Relationships with superiors and colleagues | Poor                | Good              | Good            |

7.3 Setting the Level of Difficulty of the Budget 
Research has shown that: 
· Targets can be used to motivate employees; 
· If individuals have higher levels of intended achievement, their actual achievement rises. 
But if targets are too easy to achieve (e.g. basic standards), individuals will not be motivated to improve performance. On the other hand, targets which are too difficult (e.g. ideal standards) can be demotivating. Research suggests that targets which are just out of reach are optimal for motivation (e.g. just above the current standard). This is only a general rule. The optimal target may be different from individual to individual. Note that an adverse variance may be produced even though performance has been maximised. Care must be taken to ensure that the budget holder does not react adversely to this. A solution to the adverse variance might be to use a lower standard for performance evaluation. 

7.4 Benefits and Difficulties of Employee Participation 
The benefits of bottom-up budgeting, whereby managers or employees participate in the setting of their budgets, have already been discussed in this chapter. The same benefits apply to setting other performance targets. 
7.4.1 Benefits of Employee Participation 
· Employees are more likely to accept and work towards targets they have been involved in setting. 
· Employees will be more motivated if they are given more autonomy. 
· The targets should be realistic, as employees would not agree to targets which are not. 
7.4.2 Potential Problems of Employee Participation 
· Employees may try to set targets which are too easy. In budgets, they may add "slack" to the budgets. Budgetary slack means adding expenses to the budget in excess of what is really needed. 
· Setting the targets is likely to be more time consuming if employees are involved. 
· Setting of targets may not be fair, given that some employees will be better negotiators than others and will, therefore, be able to negotiate lower targets. 

8.1 Criticisms of Traditional Budgeting 
For many years there has been much criticism of the traditional budgetary processes. Hope and Fraser detail these criticisms in their book Beyond Budgeting. This looks at the problems inherent in the traditional budgeting process, and suggests an alternative approach to performance management, the "Beyond Budgeting" model. In discussing budgets, Hope and Fraser use a broader definition of budgeting than simply producing a financial plan. They mean the whole performance measurement process of agreeing on the targets, setting reward schemes based on achieving those targets, using budgets to allocate resources, and controlling performance based on this process. They refer to this as the "fixed performance contract". The main criticisms of this budgeting model as described by Hope and Fraser are as follows: 

8.1.1 Budgets Take Up Too Much Time The budgeting process takes up too much of the time of senior management, and does not add sufficient value to the organisation to justify this. 

8.1.2 Traditional Budgeting is Irrelevant in the Modern Business Environment In the more competitive environments that have existed since the 1980s, businesses must react quickly to customer needs. This requires transferring power from the centre to managers who are closer to the customers. The old "command and control" structure of organisations represented by traditional budgeting process has become outdated. The primary drivers of shareholder value in the modern business world are intellectual capital such as brands, loyal customers and proven management teams. These are outside of the orbit of the budgetary control system. 

8.1.3 Dysfunctional Behaviour Budgets were initially introduced as a planning tool for managing costs and cash flows. However, over time budgets also came to be used as performance management tools for managing the business. The "fixed performance contract" was introduced, as follows: 
· A fixed target - usually expressed in terms of budgeted sales, costs, profits and ratios such as return on capital employed. 
· Incentives were introduced based on achieving these targets, such as bonuses and promotions for achieving the budgets. 
· Resources are allocated to departments based on the budget. 
This system sounds good in theory, but in practice it can lead to an annual "performance trap" whereby the actions of all managers are focused on meeting the performance targets of the current year. This may lead to dysfunctional behaviour, or gaming. Gaming means manipulating a system to achieve some advantage (e.g. building slack into budgets). During their research, Hope and Fraser encountered the following examples of gaming: 
· Managers negotiate the lowest targets and the highest rewards. 
· Always make the bonus whatever it takes (e.g. by "window dressing"). For example, ensuring that sales targets are met by making sales on a "sale or return" basis at the end of the financial year to a friend. The following year the goods are returned. 
· Never put the customer above the sales targets. 
· Never share knowledge or resources with other teams. 
· Ask for more resources than you need. You will be cut back to what you actually need. 
· Always spend what's in the budget or you will lose it. 
· Always be able to explain adverse variances on causes beyond your control. 
· Never provide accurate forecasts - hide bad news or you will be expected to compensate. 
· Always meet the numbers, never beat them. · Never take risks. 

8.2 Beyond Budgeting Model 
Beyond Budgeting - a set of guiding principles to enable an organisation to manage its performance and decentralise its decision-making process without the need for traditional budgets. 
Hope and Fraser suggest that the traditional budgetary control process should be replaced by the following system: 
· Replace financial targets with targets based onkey performance indicators (KPIs) and use "stretch goals" for planning that are not linked to reward schemes. 
· Appraise managers using comparisons with peers and benchmarks and reward them accordingly. 
· Devolve responsibility for planning away from the centre. 
· Manage resources to be available for worthwhile opportunities. 
· Use rolling forecasts, performance league tables and other KPIs to measure and control performance rather than just relying on comparison of actual performance against the budget. 

8.2.1 Setting Targets 
Stretch goal - a goal that requires an organisation or person to push themselves to their limits. 
Where managers rewards are linked to achieving fixed financial targets, managers negotiate the lowest targets. This means that the organisation does not achieve its potential. Beyond budgeting encourages managers to set challenging targets or "stretch goals" that cannot be achieved by making small improvements to existing performance. 
· Managers are asked what their department could achieve if it aimed to maximise performance over the short to medium term. 
· Since their rewards will not depend on achieving these targets, managers will not have an incentive to simply negotiate easy targets. Raising targets encourages maximum profit potential. 
· Setting targets based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs; measures tied to critical success factors) is quicker than setting detailed financial budgets, therefore reducing the time spent on budgeting. 
· Targets set are more aligned with the strategy of the organisation than financial targets. 

8.2.2 Rewarding People 
In traditional budgeting, fixed targets are set at the start of the year and managers are rewarded if they achieve those targets, regardless of any external changes in the environment. This leads to manipulation of data and gaming - an attitude of "make the target whatever it takes". 
· Beyond budgeting uses relative targets (e.g. how managers perform compared to peers) or benchmarks (e.g. profits compared to competitors or market share). 
· Targets are therefore more relevant and realistic, unlike internally set targets. 
· Targets are also fairer, as they take into account changes in the external environment automatically; if the economy is not doing well in a particular year, the competitor's profits will also be lower. This helps to eliminate gaming as managers now see that the targets are fair. 

8.2.3 Action Planning 
In traditional budgeting, budgets are often prepared at the start of the year using top-down methods. These fix the behaviour that is expected of the managers. The problem is that in a dynamic business environment, organisations need to be able to react quickly to changes (e.g. to customer demand). The traditional budget limits such reaction. ·
· In the beyond budgeting model, business unit managers and front-line staff develop their own plans for maximising customer satisfaction and shareholder wealth. 
· The role of senior management is to provide higher-level targets and to challenge the plans produced by business unit managers. 
· Unit managers will typically prepare medium-term goals on an annual basis and short-term goals on a quarterly basis. They can therefore respond to changing demand and anticipate business threats and opportunities. This continuous and open process allows teams to create value. 

8.2.4 Managing Resources In traditional budgeting, budgets decide how resources should be allocated to each department. If new projects become available that were not envisaged when the budget was prepared, funds may not be made available for them. This may lead to good business opportunities being missed. 
· In the beyond budgeting model, resource decisions are devolved to front-line teams, making them more responsive. Managers are more accountable; there is greater ownership and less waste. 
· Funds are allocated to projects based on a "fast track" review process (i.e. if front-line teams need additional resources, they will be approved if they meet agreed criteria). 

8.2.5 Coordinating Actions 
In traditional budgeting, the budgets of all departments are coordinated. According to Hope and Fraser, although the departments may be coordinated with each other, they are not aligned with the strategy of the organisation. An additional problem is that it is not enough to perform this coordination once every year. 
· In beyond budgeting, coordination occurs through cross-company interaction. 
· Service level agreements between the different departments are used to coordinate their activities. Under such agreements one department commits to providing goods or services to another, based on expected demand, covering an appropriate time frame. 
· Operating capacity rises and falls according to demand, rather than to meet a predetermined budget. Production is more flexible and there is less waste as fewer items are made for inventory. 

8.2.6 Controlling Performance 
In traditional budgeting systems, control is exercised by comparing actual performance against budget and asking managers to explain any variances. Corrective action is then taken to bring actual performance back into line with the budget. This leads to too much focus on the short term, according to Hope and Fraser. Few organisations focus beyond the end of the current financial year. 
· Beyond budgeting model uses a more diverse range of forward-looking indicators to manage performance. There is a greater focus on trends and forecasts. 
· Extensive use of rolling forecasts and leading indicators provide managers with a view of what will happen in the future. 
· There is also greater use of comparison of KPIs achieved against benchmarks and the use of league tables. This provides managers with a more sophisticated view of performance and should eliminate manipulation of data.

8.3 Evaluation of Beyond Budgeting 
8.3.1 Advantages 
· Divisional managers will be more motivated as they will be given autonomy to plan for their own business units.
· Creates a climate based on competitive success. Using relative performance measures and comparing performance with external benchmarks encourages managers to focus on beating competitors rather than other managers. 
· Faster response to changes in customer needs as managers can react quickly to new threats and opportunities rather than adhere to an outdated budget. Resources will also be made available for new projects if they are worthwhile even if not originally in the budget. 
· Performance is not only focused on financial numbers but on KPIs that reflect the organisation's overall objectives (KPIs are covered in detail in Chapter 15). 
· More customer-focused attitude of departments that supply other internal departments. 

8.3.2 Disadvantages 
· The organisational culture may not support this approach (e.g. where senior managers are accustomed to a command-and-control style of management). 
· May not be appropriate in organisations in which financial control is crucial to success (e.g. in public sector organisations where funds are limited). 

Summary:
· A budgetary control system is a means by which management exercises control over the organisation through setting budgets and comparing performance against the budget. Action is taken to remedy deviations from the budget.
· The main objectives of a budgetary control system are planning, coordination of the activities of the organisation and ensuring better resource utilisation.
· Budgets may also be used to delegate responsibility to managers, who are then evaluated on how they perform relative to the budget.
· Budgets should contribute towards the long-term plans of the organisation.
· Top-down budgeting means that budgets are prepared by senior management and imposed on the departments responsible for achieving them.
· Bottom-up budgeting means that departments participate in preparing their own budgets.
· A rolling budget is continuously updated and most likely suitable in a rapidly changing environment where the original budget quickly becomes outdated.
· Incremental budgeting is a traditional approach to budgeting which bases next year’s budget on the current year's budget or actual figures.
· ZBB starts “from scratch” and requires the costs and benefits of all activities to be quantified and justified. It is particularly useful in the public sector but costly and time-consuming to implement.
· Activity-based budgets use ABC principles to calculate the budgeted overhead costs.
· Budgets influence the behaviour of managers, because their evaluation depends on whether they achieve the budget. Research suggests that targets that are just out of reach are optimal for motivation.
· The Beyond Budgeting model aims to replace traditional budgetary control systems with a more modern approach which replaces financial targets with key performance indicators.



Chapter 10: Analytical Techniques
This chapter covers the following Learning Outcomes. D. Budgeting and Control 2. Analytical Techniques a) Analyse fixed and variable cost elements from total cost data using the high-low method. b) Explain and apply analysis techniques including correlation, regression and time series. c) Estimate the learning rate and learning effect. d) Apply the learning curve to a budgetary problem, including calculations on steady states. e) Discuss the benefits and limitations of correlation, regression and time series techniques, and also the reservations with the learning curve model. 

1.1 Need for Forecasting 
Management accountants need to use forecasts for many areas of their work. For example, in budgeting it is useful to be able to forecast sales. This chapter revises the calculations of the high-low method, time series, correlation and regression, all assumed knowledge of Management Accounting and introduces a new topic, the learning curve. 

1.2 Simple Average Growth Models Such models take average growth from the past, using the geometric mean, and assume that this level of growth will continue in the future. 
Example of Geometric Mean 
The sales of Beta during the last three years were as follows: 
Year Sales in $000 
20X2 100 
20X3 180 
20X4 210 
20X5 300 
The growth rate of sales each year is as follows: 
20X3 80% (180 - 100)/100 
20X4 16.67% (210 - 180)/180 
20X5 42.9% (300 - 210)/210 
The simple average growth rate is 46.5%, calculated as (80% + 16.67% + 42.9%)/3. 
However, this overstates the rate of growth: If the 20X2 sales of $100,000 were to increase by 46.5% each year for three years, the sales in 20X5 would be $314,000, not $300,000. 
The more accurate growth rate is obtained using the geometric mean. This is used to calculate average growth rates and is most commonly used in business and finance to calculate growth rates in percentages. Growing by 80% is the same as multiplying by 1.8, so the geometric mean for the three years is cube root(1.8 * 1.1667 * 1.429) = 1.442, so the average growth rate is 44.2%. 
This can then be used to calculate expected sales in future periods. 

1.3 High-Low Method 
The high-low method is a technique for estimating the fixed and variable elements of a semi-variable cost so that more accurate forecasts of costs can be made. The method is simple: 
· Collect a range of data points over a period of time corresponding to different levels of activity; 
· Select the costs (y) associated with the highest and lowest levels of activity (x) and assume a straight- line relationship between these two points. 
This method is limited by its simplicity. Furthermore, using only the extreme levels of activity to determine the relationship between two variables is risky, as extreme values are likely to be unusual. Great care should be exercised when forecasting costs outside the range of the extremes (i.e. extrapolating).

Quiz: Cost Equation 
The total cost of output for the last four months is as follows: 
| Output | Costs |
| 3,000  | 3,500 |
| 2,400  | 3,000 |
| 3,600  | 4,350 |
| 4,000  | 4,800 |
Required: a. Find the equation y = a + bx, where y is cost, and x is output level. b. Forecast next month's cost if output is expected to be 4,500 units. 

Answer:
a. Linear equation 
|      | Output | Costs |
| High | 4,000  | 4,800 |
| Low  | 2,400  | 3,000 |
y = a + bx 
Gradient, b = (4,800-3,000)/(4,000-2,400) = 1,800/1,600 = 18/16 =1.125 
Substituting in the low level of activity (alternatively, use the high level) When x = 2,400 y = 3,000 
3,000 = a + (1.125 × 2,400) 
3,000 = a + 2,700 
a = 300 
y = 300 + 1.125x 

b. Forecast for next month Cost = 300 + (1.125 * 4,500) - $5,362.50

Quiz: High-Low Method 
A new battery will be manufactured on a machine currently owned by Corfe Co, which was previously used for a product which has now been discontinued. Maximum demand for this new battery would be 262,500 units. 
The management accountant estimates that every 1,000 units will take 14 hours to produce. The annual machine hours and maintenance costs for the machine for the last four years have been as follows: 
|        | Machine time (hours) | Maintenance costs |
|        |                      | $000              |
| Year 1 | 5,000                | 850               |
| Year 2 | 4,400                | 735               |
| Year 3 | 4,850                | 815               |
| Year 4 | 1,800                | 450               |

Maintenance costs have both fixed and variable elements.
Required: Calculate the estimated maintenance cost for production of the battery at 80% of maximum demand. 

Answer:
Variable cost per hour ($850,000 - $450,000)/(5,000 - 1,800 hours) = $125 per hour T
herefore, fixed cost ($850,000 - (5,000 * $125)) = $225,000 
Production demanded is 80% of 262,500 units, which is 210,000 units. 
Number of machine hours required for production (210 * 14 hours) = 2,940 hours 
Therefore, total cost ($225,000 + (2,940 * $125)) = $592,500.

2.1 Components of a Time Series 
Time series analysis can be applied to any figures that vary over time, including sales, production and costs. 
The main components of a time series are: 
· Trend (T) 
· Seasonal variations (S) 
· Cyclical variations (C) 
· Random variations due to non-recurring influences (I) 
Random variations are usually due to unforeseen events and situations, and their degree of impact is difficult to predict. They may be favourable, i.e. positive in nature (e.g., unexpected withdrawal from the market of a competitor), or adverse, i.e. negative (e.g., damage to business due to freak weather conditions). A time series (Y) can be summarised in an equation as: 
Y = T + S + C + I 

2.1.1 Trend  
Trend - the underlying long-term movement in values over time. 

Example of Trend 
Millstream Co manufactures three products -Red, Blue and Green. Sales over recent years of the products have been as follows: 
|      | Blue  | Red   | Green |
|      | Units | Units | Units |
| 20X0 | 9,000 | 4,500 | 4,850 |
| 20X1 | 8,500 | 5,000 | 5,200 |
| 20X2 | 8,200 | 5,750 | 4,900 |
| 20X3 | 7,400 | 5,600 | 4,800 |
| 20X4 | 7,700 | 5,900 | 5.100 |
| 20X5 | 7,300 | 6,300 | 4,900 |
| 20×6 | 6,800 | 6,550 | 5,000 |
Sales of Blue show a clear downward trend, even though they rose in 20X4. Sales of Red show a clear upward trend, even though they fell in 20X3. Sales of Green show a constant trend of around 5,000 units. 

2.1.2 Seasonal Variations 
Seasonal variations - short-term fluctuations in value caused by differing circumstances affecting results at different times of the day, week, month, year, etc. Factors causing seasonal variations may include: 
· The weather (e.g. products selling better in hot rather than cold weather); 
· Annual events (e.g. new year retail sales, "Black Friday", etc.); 
· Customers have more time to shop (e.g. on weekends rather than weekdays). 

Example of Seasonal Variations
The sales for one of Leybourne Co's products over each season in the last three years are as follows. Each season lasts three months. 
|              |  Units |
| Spring 20X0  | 5,500  |
| Summer 20X0  | 6,700  |
| Autumn 20X0  | 5,600  |
| Winter 20X0  | 4,700  |
| Spring 20X1  | 5,900  |
| Summer 20X1  | 7,200  |
| Autumn 20X1  | 6,300  |
| Winter 20X1  | 5,100  |
| Spring 20X2  | 6,500  |
| Summer 20X2  | 7,900  |
| Autumn 20X2  | 7,000  |
| Winter 20X2  | 5,700  |
The figures for each season in 20X1 and 20X2 are higher than those for the preceding year, showing an upward trend overall. However, there are significant seasonal variations (e.g. Winter 20X2 is lower than Summer 20X0). 

2.1.3 Cyclical variations 
Cyclical variations - medium-term changes in values resulting from factors that repeat in cycles. Cyclical variations are longer-term than seasonal variations. 
Economic cycles - the alternation between booms and recessions -exemplify cyclical variations. 

2.2 Identifying the Trend The trend can be found using: 
· A "line of best fit" drawn on a graph;  
· The least squares method of linear regression (see s.3). 
· The calculation of moving averages. 

2.2.1 Moving Averages Method 
Moving averages method- removes seasonal variations from data by averaging, taking the average of the results of a fixed number of periods. The moving average model smooths out data sets to reveal their overall trend, with little regard for outlying data points. To calculate the trend: 1. Calculate a "moving" total for the number of periods which make up a normal cycle (usually a year). 2. Calculate a "moving" average by dividing the moving total by the number of periods in a normal cycle. This is the trend figure (T). 3. When the moving average is for an even number of periods (e.g. 4 quarters), the averages in (2) must be averaged again. This is so that the final computed moving average can be compared directly to a data point in the actual data. 

2.3 Identifying the Seasonal Variations 
Seasonal variations quantify changes in actual data due to prevailing conditions in a particular season, which is consistent over time (e.g. summer would have seasonally higher temperatures than winter, which would be consistently true every year; or people travel more during peak holiday seasons). When forecasting, seasonal variations are added to the forecast trend to account for potential future seasonal conditions. 

2.3.1 Additive Model Having identified the trend, the next stage is identifying the seasonal variations. Using the equation: 
Y= T + S + C + I 
Ignoring C (as we are looking at short-term forecasting) and I (which is impossible to predict): 
Y = T + S, therefore S = Y -T 
The additive model assumes that the components of the time series are independent, meaning the trend will not affect the seasonal variations. To calculate the seasonal variations: 1. For each trend value (T), calculate the seasonal variation (i.e. the difference between the actual data and the trend figure). 2. Calculate the average of the seasonal variation for each period in a cycle (e.g. quarterly data will have four averages, one for each quarter). 3. If the average seasonal variations calculated do not sum to 0, make a final adjustment to each variation so that the total equals 0. The example below uses a moving average set with odd numbers, so the moving average only has to be computed once to be comparable to the data point in the actual data. 

Example of Seasonal Variations - Additive Model 
Frances opens a cafe from Tuesday to Saturday each week. A sales trend is therefore calculated using a 5-day moving average. The daily variations (Step 1) are then calculated as the difference between actual sales and the trend for each day as follows: 
| Week  | Day.  | Actual(Y) | 5-day moving total | 5-day moving average(T) | Seasonal variation (S = Y-T)|
|               | $000      | $000               | $000                    | $000  			 |
|	| Tues  | 330       |                    |			   | 				 |
|	| Wed   | 400       |                    |			   | 				 |
|  1	| Thurs | 360       | 1,990              | 398			   | -38			 |
|	| Fri   | 430       | 2,000              | 400			   | +30			 |
|	| Sat   | 470       | 2,020              | 404			   | +66			 |

|  	| Wed   | 420       | 2,060              | 412			   | -67			 |
|	| Thurs | 375       | 2,095              | 419			   | -44			 |
|	| Fri   | 455       | 2,110              | 422		           | +33			 |
|	| Sat   | 505       | 2,140              | 428			   | +77			 |

|  3	| Tues  | 355       | 2,160              | 432			   | -77			 |
|  	| Wed   | 450       | 2,190              | 438			   | +12			 |

|	| Fri   | 485       |                    | 			   | 				 |
|	| Sat   | 545       |                    | 			   | 				 |

Step 2. Calculate the average of the seasonal (i.e. daily) variations. 
|         | Tues | Wed  | Thurs | Fri    | Sat    |
|         | $000 | $000 | $000 | $000    | $000   |
| Week 1  |      |      | -38   | + 30   | + 66   |
| Week 2  | -67  | + 8  | -44   | + 33   | + 77   |
| Week 3  | -77  | + 12 | -51   |        |        |
| Average | -72  | + 10 | -44.3 | + 31.5 | + 71.5 | - 3.3 |

Step 3. Add 3.3/5 = 0.66 to each variation to ensure the averages total 0: 
|                  | Tues   | Wed     | Thurs  | Fri     | Sat     | Total |
|                  | $000   | $000    | $000   | $000    | $000    | $000  |
| Average          | -72    | + 10    | -44.3  | + 31.5  | + 71.5  | -3.3  |
| Adjustment       | 0.66   | 0.66    | 0.66   | 0.66    | 0.66    | 3.3   |
| Adjusted average | -71.34 | + 10.66 | -43.64 | + 32.16 | + 72.16 | 0     |
The seasonal variation is negative on Tuesdays and Thursdays and positive on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. 
The seasonal variations will be added to the forecast trend to account for expected future seasonal variations on those days.

2.3.2 Multiplicative Model 
The multiplicative model is based on proportions rather than absolute values and is expressed as: Y = T * S * C *l Or ignoring C and I, Y = T * S and therefore S = Y/T. 
The seasonal variation expressed as a proportion of the trend is sometimes called a seasonal index. The other difference between the calculations using the additive and multiplicative models is that the average seasonal index should sum to the number of seasons in the time series (e.g. 12 for monthly variations, 4 for quarterly variations).

2.4 Seasonally-adjusted Data 
Seasonally-adjusted ("deseasonalised") data (i.e. actual data that has been stripped of seasonal variations) can be used to explore the trend and any remaining random component. When actual data is given, and seasonally-adjusted figures are required: 
· For the additive model: subtract positive variations from actual data and add negative variations to actual data; 
· For the multiplicative model: divide actual data by the seasonal variation factors. 

Example of Seasonally-adjusted Data - Multiplicative Model 
Data for sales on the days of one week is as follows: 
|       | Actual sales (Y) | Seasonal index (S) | Deseasonalised data (Y/S) |
| $     | $                | $                  |
| Mon   | 7,500            | 0.91               | 8,242                     |
| Tues  | 8,100            | 0.98               | 8,265                     |
| Wed   | 8,400            | 1.01               | 8.317                     |
| Thurs | 8,200            | 0.98               | 8,367                     |
| Fri   | 8,900            | 1.06               | 8,396                     |
| Sat   | 9,100            | 1.07               | 8,505                     |
| Sun   | 8,500            | 0.99               | 8,586                     |
The de-seasonalised data may be compared to the forecast trend to see if any significant variations are not accounted for in seasonal variations and may be linked to cyclical or random variations.

2.5 Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis 
A trend can be used to predict future values by extrapolating beyond the historic values using a graph or an equation that describes the trend (e.g. using regression as described in the next section). Once a trend value has been calculated for a future period, it must be adjusted for seasonal variations using the additive or multiplicative model. In time series analysis, each period will be given an integer. For example, if Year 1 Month 1 is identified as 1, Year 2 Month 1 will be 13, etc. 

Example of Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis 
The trend for quarterly profits is described by the equation below: 64,000 + 1000x, where x is the number of quarters and x = 1 represents 20X1 Quarter 1. The seasonal index for Quarter 2 is 0.96. 
The profit forecast for 20X4 Quarter 2 (i.e. ((4 * 3) + 2)) = Quarter 14) is: 
Forecast trend = 64,000 + 1,000(14) = $78,000 
Adjusting for seasonal index, forecast profits = $78,000 * 0.96 = $74,880

Quiz: Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis
The trend for quarterly sales volume is described by the equation below: 100,000x + 170,000, where x is the number of quarters and x = 0 represents 20X1 Quarter 1. The seasonal variation for Quarter 3 is +40,000 units. 
Required: Calculate the forecast sales volume for 20X5, Quarter 3. 

Answer:
For 20X5 Q3, x = 18 (i.e. ((4 * 4) + 3 - 1), because x = 0 at 20X1 Q1) 
Trend sales volume = (100,000 * 18) + 170,000 = 1,970,000 units 
Forecast sales volume = 1,970,000 + 40,000 = 2,010,000 units

2.6 Benefits and Limitations of Time Series Analysis 
2.6.1 Benefits of Time Series Analysis 
· It enables future predictions based on past experience. 
· As compared to the high-low method, it ignores outlying data points. 
· Analysing data into parts facilitates more accurate forecasting (than using trend alone). 

2.6.2 Limitations of Time Series Analysis 
· Data must be ordered over time (i.e. the point in time at which the variable is measured must be known) to calculate the trend 
· The reliability of a forecast depends on the amount of data on which the trend and seasonal variations are based. The less data that is available, the less reliable the forecast will be. 
· Due to the "loss" of data in calculating moving averages, data needs to be collected over a longer period for a meaningful trend to emerge using the moving averages method. 
· Random factors may influence calculations, especially over fewer data sets. If non-recurring influences are significant, forecasts may not be reliable. 
· Extrapolation becomes less reliable the further into the future the forecast is made due to changes in trends, seasonal variations and other (residual) factors. 

3.1 Correlation
Correlation -the closeness of the relationship between two or more variables. Examples of variables that might be correlated include: 
· Length of journey on public transport and fare paid; 
· Hours spent studying and marks in an exam. 
Correlation between variables can be shown on a scattergraph. 

3.1.1 Types of Correlation 
The following phrases are commonly used to describe correlation between variables: 
· Positive correlation - when an increase in one variable is associated with an increase in the other (e.g. advertising expense and revenue). 
· Negative correlation - when an increase in one variable is associated with a decrease in the other (e.g. bicycle traffic and rainfall). 
· Perfect correlation - when a change in one variable is matched by a change of equal degree in the other variable. This only exists when all the points of a scattergraph lie on a straight line. 
· Zero correlation - when there is no relationship between the variables. Between the extremes of perfect and zero correlation, the correlation may be described as "high" or "low". 

3.2 Correlation Coefficient (r) 
3.2.1 Exam Formula The degree of correlation between two variables can be measured using the correlation coefficient, r, which is given by the exam formula:
r = (nΣxy- ΣxΣy)/square root((nΣx2 - (Σx)2)(nΣy2 - (Σy)2))
Where: 
n = the number of pairs of values 
Σx = the sum of the x values 
Σx2 = the sum of the squares of the x values
(Σx)2 = the square of the sum of the x values 
Σy = the sum of the y values 
Σy2 = the sum of the squares of the y values
(Σy)2 = the square of the sum of the y values 
Σxy = the sum of the products of each pair of x and y values 

The value of the correlation coefficient will always lie between -1 and 1: 
· r = +1 denotes perfect positive correlation (i.e. all points on an upward sloping straight line); 
· r = - 1 denotes perfect negative correlation (i.e. all points on a downward sloping straight line); and 
· r = 0 means the variables are uncorrelated (i.e. no linear relationship). 

Example of Correlation Coefficient 
Coastway Café wants to determine the extent to which the number of ice-creams sold (y) is correlated to the average daily temperature (x). The correlation coefficient is calculated from pairs of data as follows: 
| | Average daily temperature |       	     Number of ice-creams		     |
| | (x)                       | (y)                  | xy    | ×2             | y2     |
| | 14                        | 59                   | 826   | 196            | 3.481  |
| | 27                        | 102                  | 2,754 | 729            | 10,404 |
| | 20                        | 84                   | 1,680 | 400            | 7,056  |
| | 22                        | 85                   | 1,870 | 484            | 7,225  |
| | 17                        | 75                   | 1,275 | 289            | 5,625  |
|Σ| 100                       | 405                  | 8.405 | 2,098          | 33,791 |

n = 5 
(Σx)2 = 100 * 100 = 10,000 
(Σy)2 = 405 * 405 = 164,025 
r = [(5*8,405) - (100*405)]/square root((5*2,098-10,000)(5*33,791-164,025))= 0.98 
There is therefore a high positive correlation between the average daily temperature and the number of ice-creams sold.

n = 10 
(Σx)2 = 275 * 275 = 75,625

r = [(10*3,596) - (275*139)]/square root((19*8,055-75,625)(10*2,047.3-19,321))= -2,265/2,381.9 = -0.95 
There is a high negative correlation between the operating speed of the machine and the life of the component.

3.2.2 Interpretation of r 
A high correlation between two variables does not necessarily justify the conclusion that a causal relationship exists. There may be no direct connection at all, in which case the correlation is described as "spurious correlation". This can occur for two reasons: 1. There may be an indirect connection (i.e., x and y depend on a third variable). 2. The correlation may be a coincidence and due entirely to chance. 

Example of Spurious Correlation 
Total annual video game sales around the globe over the last 60 years are closely correlated to total nuclear energy production. Both variables have increased steadily, but there is no causal relationship between them. They have both increased with the increasing demands of a growing global population. 

3.3 Coefficient of Determination
The coefficient of determination measures how much of the total change in the amount of one variable can be explained by the change in the other variable. Unlike the correlation coefficient, it is a measure of the cause of the variation. It is calculated as the square of the correlation coefficient, r2, and must therefore always be a positive number. 

Example of Coefficient of Determination 
The correlation coefficient between the number of quality control tests undertaken on a line of products and the number of customer complaints is -0.8. 
The coefficient of determination is, therefore, -0.82 = 0.64. This means that 64% of the changes in the number of customer complaints can be explained by changes in the number of quality control tests. 

3.4 Regression 
Correlation describes the closeness of a linear relationship between two variables, but it does not allow forecasting of the value of one variable given the value of the other. To forecast variables, it is necessary to assume a linear relationship between them that can be described by the equation y = a + bx, where a is the point of intersection on the y-axis (i.e. when x = 0) and b is the gradient of the line. The values of a and b can be determined by: 
· Judging "by eye" a line that best fits the data plotted on a scattergraph; 
· Computing the "line of best fit" mathematically using the least squares regression method. 
The formulae are provided in the exam as follows: 
a = Σy/n - bΣx/n
b = (nΣxy - ΣxΣy)/(nΣx2 - (Σx)2)
Exam advice Calculate b first to substitute in the formula for a. 

3.5 Benefits and Limitations 
3.5.1 Benefits of Correlation and Regression Analysis 
· Correlation analysis can indicate the existence of associations between variables. 
· As least squares regression uses all pairs of data it is much more accurate than the high-low method and less affected by extreme values. 
· Correlation can be used with regression analysis to indicate the strength of the relationship indicated by the equation. 

3.5.2 Limitations of Correlation and Regression Analysis 
· A limited amount of data may reduce the reliability of forecasts made. The reliability of the analysis and forecasts also depends on the quality of the data. 
· Correlation is easily misinterpreted as high correlation does not necessarily indicate a linear relationship, and there may be no direct connection between highly correlated variables. 
· Linear regression analysis is based on the assumptions of a linear relationship, which may not be valid, and assumes that the dependent variable depends solely on the independent variable, whereas it may depend on a number of variables. 
· Forecasts that extrapolate values outside the range of data from the past, may be invalid and must be interpreted with caution. 

4.1 The Learning Effect 
If workers specialise, there is a tendency for labour hours per unit to fall as they become more familiar with the task. During World War II, empirical evidence from aircraft production found the rate of improvement to be so regular that it could be reduced to a formula. The learning effect starts from the production of the first unit/batch. Each time cumulative production doubles (i.e. one to two, two to four, four to eight, etc.), the cumulative average time per unit falls to a fixed percentage of the previous average time. This percentage is the learning rate. It is important to recognise the learning effect. For example, when launching a new product at a cost plus price, if the cost is overstated, the price may be too high, reducing sales volume. Or worse still, the product might not be launched at all in the mistaken belief that it costs too much.

4.3 Learning Curve Formula Although a graph could be used to provide an estimate, it is more accurate to use the following exam formula: 
y = a * x raised to the power of b
Where y = cumulative average time per unit to produce x units a = time taken for the first unit of output x = the cumulative number of units produced b = the index of learning (log LR/log2) LR = the learning rate as a decimal

Quiz: Labour Cost 
McSporran is a new business. It is budgeting costs for the production of kilts. Work studies show that the first batch will have a labour cost of $2,000, and an 85% learning effect applies. In period 1, budget production is 5 batches. In period 2, budgeted production is 7 batches. The wage rate per hour will be constant. (Therefore, using $s rather than hours in the formula is possible.) 
Required: Calculate the budgeted labour cost for period 2. 
Note: The index of learning b is given as -0.2345. 

Labour cost for period 2 = Total cost for 12 batches - Total cost for 5 batches (period 1 and 2) (period 1) 
Total cost for 12 batches = 12 (2,000 * (12 raised to the power of -0.2345)) = $13,401 
Total cost for 5 batches = 5 (2,000 * (5 raised to the power of-0.2345)) = $6,856 
Labour cost for period 2 = 13,401 - 6,856 = $6,545

4.4 Conditions for a Learning Curve to Apply Conditions for a learning curve to apply include the following: 
· The activity is labour intensive. 
· The units are identical (i.e. a repetitive task). 
· Low labour turnover. 
· No prolonged breaks in production. 

4.5 Applications of Learning Curve Theory 
Learning curve theory has applications in many aspects of management accounting: 
· Standard setting - the labour standard should be set/revised based on the expected learning effect. 
· Budgeting - variable costs per unit are expected to fall with an increase in production - which is particularly important to cash budgeting. 
· Pricing decisions - an accurate labour cost may be predicted. 
· Work scheduling - workforce planning (e.g. in systems which integrate production scheduling, job costing, control of workforce, performance measurement, etc.). 

4.6 Reservations About the Learning Curve 
· Knowing what the learning rate will be for new products. The usual assumption is that it will be similar to products made in the past. This may not always be a valid assumption. 
· The learning curve is useful when a product's production occurs continuously. However, if there is a break in production, workers may "forget" the skill and the learning curve will not be so predictable. 
· In the modern business world, many products are tailor-made for customers. The mass production of identical items, on which the learning effect is based, is not always appropriate. 
· In some heavily unionised industries, there may be "go slow" agreements where workers agree not to work to their full capacity to save jobs. 

4.7 Steady State With more repetitions, the improvements get smaller until, eventually, the learning process stops and reaches a "steady state". There are no further improvements to be made. As cumulative output increases, the effect of the learning curve diminishes. When cumulative output reaches a certain point, no further learning will occur. The time taken per unit reaches a steady state, and all units produced beyond this point will take the same amount of time per unit. 
Incremental time per unit (steady state) = Total time (all units at steady state) - Total time (all units before steady state) 

Example of Steady State Computation 
Drake Co is budgeting the labour hours it needs to produce its new product, the Rega. Drake Co estimates that the learning rate of its workforce on this production is 85%, and that steady state is reached on the 20th unit. The index of learning b is given as -0.2345. The time taken to produce the first unit is 2 hours. Calculate the incremental labour time per unit for the 20th and subsequent units. The incremental time per unit can be computed by deducting the total time required to make 19 units from the total time needed to make 20 units. That time would apply for the 20th and all subsequent units. 
|                                                            | Hours   |
| Total time taken to make the first 20 units (Woring)       | 19.814  |
| Less: Total time taken to make the first 19 units (Working)| 19.051  |
| Time taken to make the 20th and subsequent units           | 0.763   |
WORKING Using the formula Y = a * (x raise to be power of b) 
b = - 0.2345 (given) 
a= 2 
For first 20 units: Cumulative average time per unit, Y = (2)(20 raised to the power of -0.2345) = 0.99069 
Total time (20 * 0.99069)  = 19.814
For first 19 units: 
Cumulative average time per unit, Y = (2)(19 raised to the power of -0.2345) = 1.00268 
Total time (19 * 1.00268) = 1.00268 
The 20th unit took 0.763 hours to produce. This would apply to all units produced after the 20th unit. For example, if total production was 100 units, the total labour hours would be: 19.814 hours (Total time to make 20 units) + 80 * 0.763 hours (steady state incremental time per unit) = 19.814 + 61.033 = 80.847 hours (total time to produce 100 units) 

Key Point 
Steady state is achieved when the incremental time per unit is constant. Note that even after steady state is reached, the cumulative average time per unit would still be decreasing.

Quiz: Learning Curve and Steady State 
Supercars produces cars on a production line. One of the production line processes, Process 10, is labour intensive. A new model, the XY123, will be introduced to production next month. As this is a new model, the labourers in Process 10 will have to learn how to apply this process specifically to XY123. The time taken for the first car is expected to be one hour. A learning rate of 85% is expected. The effect of the learning curve is expected to stop after 30 units have been produced, and all subsequent units will take the same time to make as the 30th unit. Supercars has budgeted to manufacture 100 XY123s in the first month of production. 
Required: a. Calculate the labour time per unit which will apply for the 30th and subsequent units. b. Calculate the total labour time to make the first 100 units of the XY123. Note: The index of learning b is given as -0.2345.

| Total time (29 × 0.45401)                             |         | 13.166 |
Exam advice For the total hours to be accurate to 3 decimal places, it is necessary to calculate the average times per unit to 5 decimal places (because they are to be multiplied by numbers between 10 and 100) 

b. Total labour time for the first 100 units After the 30th unit, the time per unit remains constant at 0.347 hours per unit, the same as the time taken for the 30th unit, since the learning effect ceases at this point. 
|                                                       | Hours |
| Total time taken to make the first 30 units (per (a)) | 13.51 |
| Time taken to make the next 70 units (70 x 0.347)     | 24.29 |
| Time taken to make the first 100 units (hours)        | 37.80 |

4.8 Estimating the Learning Rate 
4.8.1 Tabular Approach A learning rate for a new product can be estimated using a tabular approach based on production to date and the time taken, if the cumulative units are given in exponentials of 2 (e.g. 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on). The point at which the learning rate stops (i.e. when a "steady state" is reached, as described above) can also be calculated. It is when the incremental time per unit becomes constant. 

Quiz: Learning Rate 
Foxy Co makes personal computers. The components for the PCs are bought from various manufacturers, and the factory workers at Foxy Co assemble these to make a finished PC. Production of a new type of PC has just begun. The management accountant has asked a worker to keep a record of how much time they took to make each new computer. The worker provided the following summary for the first month: 
|                    | Incremental time taken (minutes) |
| 1st unit           | 340                              |
| 2nd unit           | 204                              |
| 3rd and 4th units  | 326                              |
| 5th to 8th units   | 522                              |
| 9th to 16th units  | 964                              |
| 17th to 32nd units | 1.928                            |
| Total              | 4.284                            |
The time shown within each band is the total for that band, not the average per computer.
Required: a. Calculate the learning rate that applied to the new PC. b. Estimate the point at which the learning period finishes. 

Answer:
a. Learning rate
| Cumulative output (units) | Cumulative total time (minutes) | Cumulative average time per unit (minutes) |
| 1                         | 340                             | 340                                        |
| 2                         | 544                             | 272                                        |
| 4                         | 870                             | 217.5                                      |
| 8                         | 1,392                           | 174                                        |
| 16                        | 2,356                           | 147.25                                     |
| 32                        | 4,284                           | 133.875                                    |
As cumulative output doubles: 
From 1 to 2 units: 272/340 = 80% 
From 2 to 4 units: 217.5/272 = 80% 
Therefore, the learning rate appears to be 80%. 

b. End of the learning period The learning rate ends when the incremental time per unit becomes constant. Because there is no information about the time taken for each individual item, it is necessary to calculate the average incremental time for each group or band of units produced. When this becomes constant, the learning process ends: 
|                    | Incremental time taken | Average incremental time |
| 1st unit           | 340                    | 340                      |
| 2nd unit           | 204                    | 204                      |
| 3rd and 4th units  | 326                    | 163                      |
| 5th to 8th units   | 522                    | 130.5                    |
| 9th to 16th units  | 964                    | 120.5                    |
| 17th to 32nd units | 1,928                  | 120.5                    |
The time taken per unit becomes constant at 120.5 from the start of the band that includes the 9th to the 16th unit. Conclusion: The learning effect ends after the 8th unit.

4.8.2 Algebraic Approach 
An algebraic approach must be used when only information about the cumulative average time is for two levels of output that are not exponentials of 2. 
Exam advice This might be the case in an objective test question. 

Example of Algebraic Approach to Learning Rate 
The first unit of a product took 300 minutes; the total time taken for the first 8 units was 2,056 minutes. Therefore, the cumulative average time per unit for the first 8 units is 257 minutes (2,056 / 8). Cumulative output has doubled three times since the production of the first unit (from 1 to 2, to 4, then to 8), and the cumulative average time per unit has fallen to 257. If the learning rate is r. 
Then, 300 x (r raised to the power of 3) = 257 
So, (r raised to the power of 3) = 257/300 = 0.8567 
Therefore, r = cube root(0.8567) = 0.9497 i.e. approximately 95%

Quiz: Expected and Actual Learning Rates 
Go Fast Cars has just started manufacturing a new model of its "lightning" sports car. The time taken for one process was two hours for the first car produced. A budget was prepared using an expected 80% learning rate based on prior experience. Recently, the company invested in sophisticated new manufacturing equipment. Workers are assisted by robots and computerised machine tools in the process in question. As this has enabled the company to reduce the workforce, several labourers have recently been made redundant. The actual production time of the first 16 units was higher than expected, suggesting that the learning rate might be greater than 80%. The budgeted and actual cumulative total times for the first 16 units are given below in minutes: 
|    | Cumulative output | Cumulative total time budgeted | Cumulative total time actual | Cumulative average time actual |
| 1  |                   | 120                            | 120                          |                                |
| 2  |                   | 192                            | 216                          |                                |
| 4  |                   | 307                            | 389                          |                                |

Required: a. Calculate the actual learning rate experienced for this process. b. Suggest reasons why the actual learning rate was higher than expected. 

Answer:
a. Actual learning rate 
| Cumulative output | Cumulative total time budgeted | Cumulative total time actual | Cumulative average time actual |
| 1                 | 120                            | 120                          | 120.00                         |
| 2                 | 192                            | 216                          | 108.00                         |
| 4                 | 307                            | 389                          | 97.25                          |
| 8                 | 492                            | 700                          | 87.50                          |
| 16                | 786                            | 1,260                        | 78.75                          |
As cumulative output doubles from 1 to 2, cumulative average time falls to 90% (108/120). This is repeated as cumulative output doubles from 2 to 4 (97.25/108), 4 to 8 (87.5/97.25) and 8 to 16 (78.75/87.5). 
The actual learning rate is, therefore, 90%. This is higher than the expected learning rate of 80%, leading to the actual time taken being higher than budgeted. 

b. Possible reasons for higher learning rate 
It is potentially confusing that a higher learning rate means the effect of learning is lower. In this activity, the actual learning rate was 90% compared with a budgeted learning rate of 80%. The higher rate meant that the actual time taken to produce the first 16 units exceeded the time budgeted. 
In the past, Go Fast Cars experienced learning rates of 80% when introducing new models. The new model has a higher learning rate of 90%, to the surprise (and no doubt disappointment) of management. It is necessary to identify the factors that may have led to this. The learning curve is most significant in more labour-intensive industries where the tasks are repetitive, there is low labour turnover, and staff members are motivated. In such situations, staff will learn more quickly, leading to a lower learning rate. Several developments at Go Fast Cars may have reduced the learning effect and led to a higher learning rate. 
· The introduction of technology means that the processes are less labour intensive. There is, therefore, less scope for learning, as much of the process is likely to be automated anyway and automated processed are likely to work at a constant rate. 
· The recent redundancies may have demotivated the remaining staff members, as they may believe that the company has little loyalty towards them. When morale is low, employees are less likely to work as productively as possible, leading to a higher learning rate.

Quiz: Algebraic Approach 
The first batch of a new product took six hours to make, and the total time for the first 16 units was 42.8 hours, at which point the learning effect ended. 
Required: Calculate the rate of learning. 

Answer:
The cumulative average time per unit for the first 16 units is 2.675 hours (42.8/16). 
Cumulative output has doubled four times since the production of the first unit (from 1 to 2, to 4, to 8, to 16). 
Therefore, if the learning rate is r. Then, 6 x (r raised to the power of 4) = 2.675 
So, (r raised to the power of 4) = 2.675/6 = 0.446 
Therefore, r = (4th root if 0.446) = 0.817 i.e. approximately 82%

Summary:
· The high-low method is a simple and crude method used to find the relationship between variables, which takes only the highest and lowest values from the observations.
· In a time series (i.e. a series of figures recorded over time), the trend is the underlying long-term movement of data values. Seasonal variations are fluctuations due to differing conditions that affect results at different times, leading to differences between actual outcomes and results predicted by the trend alone.
· A trend can be calculated using moving averages or least squares regression.
· Seasonal variations can be calculating using the additive model (Y = T + S) or the multiplicative model (Y = T * S).
· Time series analysis can forecast future results by extrapolating the trend and adjusting for seasonal variations.
· Correlation describes the relationship between changes in the value of two variables. It may be positive, negative or zero. The correlation coefficient, r, measures the degree of correlation between two variables.
· The coefficient of determination, r2, measures the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable caused by the variation in the other variable.
· Linear regression analysis can be used to determine a line of best fit and forecast the value of one of the variables.
· Learning curve theory is based on the concept that the time taken to make a unit of a product or service falls as workers become more experienced.
· As cumulative output doubles, the cumulative average time taken falls to a fixed percentage − the learning rate.
· The learning curve formula is provided in the exams.
· The steady state describes the point from which the learning effect ceases.
· There are two methods of calculating the learning effect: tabulation and an algebraic approach. Only the algebraic approach can be used when information about the cumulative average time is for only two levels of output that are not exponentials of 2.



Chapter 11: Standard Costing
This chapter covers the following Learning Outcomes. D. Budgeting and Control 3. Standard costing a) Explain the use of standard costs. b) Outline the methods used to derive standard costs and discuss the different types of cost possible. c) Explain and illustrate the importance of flexing budgets in performance management. d) Explain and apply the principle of controllability in the performance management system. 

1.1 By Management 
Standard cost - the predetermined (planned) cost of a unit of a product (goods or service) or a component of product cost (e.g. material, labour) during a specific period in the near future. It is the planned cost of a product under current and/or anticipated operating conditions. Production costs are affected by internal factors over which management has a large degree of control. An important role of executive management is to help departmental managers understand their part in contributing to the organisation's success. 
Standard costs and the variances which arise from them: 
· Keep management informed about the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of production processes. 
· Facilitate supervisory personnel being made directly responsible for the variances under their control. 
Variances provide a measure of the fairness of standards and facilitate further analysis, investigation and action (e.g. to eliminate causes of undesirable variances). 
· Adjustments should be made to an unreasonable standard if variance analysis is to be meaningful. 
· Variance analysis should encourage and reward cost control commensurate with desired levels of performance. 
Variances - differences between actual prices and standard prices and actual quantities and standard quantities. 
Variance analysis - the process of calculating and interpreting variances. 

Example of Standard Cost Card 
| Product XYZ $ Per Unit       |
| Sales price                  |                    | 100 |
| Production                   |                    |     |
| Materials                    | (2 kg @ $20/kg)    | 40  |
| Labour                       | (1.5 hrs @ $2/hr)  | 3   |
| Variable overhead            | (1.5 hrs @ $6/hr)  | 9   |
| Fixed overhead               | (1.5 hrs @ $10/hr) | 15  |
| Standard cost of production  |                    | 67  |
| Standard profit per unit     |                    | 33  |

A standard provides a "benchmark" or "norm" for measuring performance. Standards are widely used (recommended daily allowances (RDA), drinking measures, materials standards for building constructions, quality standards, health and safety standards). In management accounting, standards generally relate to two aspects of inputs used in producing goods/services: 1. Quantity standards specify how much resource (raw materials, labour) should be input to produce a unit of product/ service. 2. Price (or cost) standards stipulate how much should be paid for each unit of resource. The main reason for categorising standards - into price and quantity - is because different managers are usually responsible for the activities of buying and using inputs which occur at different points in time. For example: 
· The purchasing manager's responsibility is exercised when materials are purchased. 
· The production or factory manager's responsibility is exercised only when the materials are used, which could be months later (even in a different budget period). Management should investigate the significant variances revealed (by a comparison of actual quantities and prices against the standards) to establish their cause(s) and to take corrective action to prevent their reoccurrence. This facilitates management "by exception" because investigation is unnecessary if deviations are insignificant. However, an expectation that has not been met is an opportunity to uncover the root of the problem. If the underlying cause is not discovered and corrected, the problem is likely to recur and may worsen. 

1.2 Variance Investigation 
The main purpose of variance investigation is to improve operational performance: 
· Actual cost and performance is compared with the standard cost of actual performance. 
· The differences between actual results and what should have happened according to the standards are variances. 
· Management should consider both the nature ("why did it arise?") and magnitude ("by how much has it increased/decreased"?) of any variance. 
· A corrective action could include re-calibrating/re-setting the specifications of an item of equipment or changing a supplier. 
· An amended standard cost may be prepared for the next period. 

1.3 Uses of Standard Costing Systems 
Standard costing systems may be used to: 
· Assist in planning by providing management with insights into the probable effect of decisions on cost levels (and profits); 
· Help establish budgets (see later); 
· Control costs, direct and motivate employees and measure efficiencies; 
· Highlight opportunities for possible cost reductions; 
· Simplify the costing of products and facilitate reporting of costs on a timely basis; 
· Assign cost (e.g. through processes of allocation, apportionment and absorption) to inventories of raw materials, work in process and finished goods; 
· Provide a cost basis on which to tender for contracts/set sales prices (see chapters on relevant costing and pricing). 

1.4 Examples of Use 
· In production, many manufacturing companies use "standard cost cards" to specify the standard amount of resources (components, materials, different grades of labour, machine time, overheads, etc) and the standard price for each product. 
· Service centres for national chains of car service centres set standard labour times and parts to be used in routine car maintenance tasks (e.g. changing spark plugs, replacing exhaust/tyres, etc). Actual performance can be compared against the standards for each service centre. 
· Restaurant and drink retail outlets (e.g. Pizza Express, Starbucks) have standards for ingredients (quality, quantity and price), speed of service, etc. 
· Hotel chains may use standards for many aspects of their operations - laundry, housekeeping, restaurants and bars. 

1.5 Use of Standards in Budgeting 
Budgeting is a method by which reliable information relating to the operation and control of an entity is obtained on a timely basis. Like budgets, standard costs: 
· facilitate control and highlight possibilities for cost reductions; 
· use predetermined costs for the budget period; and 
· provide information for reports which compare actual costs with predetermined costs (see operating statements later). 
|            | Budget                                                                             | Standards                                                         |
| Scope      | A statement of expected costs (to direct activities to an agreed action plan).     | Specify what costs should be for a level of performance achieved. |
| Highlights | Volume of activity and level of costs to be maintained (as desired by management). | Level to which costs should be reduced (to increase profit).      |

2.1 Setting Standards 
Standard setting calls for the combined expertise of those responsible for procuring resource inputs and overseeing their use. For a production company, this usually will include accountants, buyers, engineering and factory supervisors and managers. Standards should be set to encourage efficient future operations and to eliminate inefficiencies. When setting standards, different approaches can be taken regarding the level of difficulty (ideal or attainable) and the time period the standard relates to. 

2.2 Ideal Standards These are standards which can only be achieved under ideal operating circumstances. They do not make allowances for: 
· Machine breakdowns 
· Interruptions to schedule 
· Idle time/capacity. 
The usefulness of ideal standards may be viewed both positively and negatively: 
· They are a constant reminder to strive to improve economy, efficiency and effectiveness. 
· They are demotivating, as managers know that they will never be able to achieve them. 
· When examining variances, it is difficult to assess how much of the adverse variance is because the standard is unrealistic or actual operations are inefficient. 

2.3 Basic Standards A basic standard is a long-run (underlying) average standard. As it is based on historical data (i.e. past performance) it has two weaknesses: 
· Out of date. x Likely to be too easy to achieve in the future.

2.4 Current Standards A current standard is established for use over a short period, reflecting current conditions. It is obtained by adjusting the expected standard. x Its main disadvantage is that it is time consuming and costly to implement (e.g. new current standards must be recalculated each month). 

2.5 Attainable Standards Attainable standards are challenging but should be attainable under existing operating conditions. They do make an allowance for a normal (i.e. expected) level of: 
· machine breakdowns; and 
· breaks (rests) by the workforce. 
They do, however, require a high, though reasonable, level of efficiency. Attainable standards are more likely to be used than ideal standards because: 
· They are achievable, so that so managers will be motivated. 
· Any variances will highlight only abnormal conditions for the attention of management. This is useful for assisting in "management by exception". 

2.6 Information Used for Setting Standards 
In setting standards, for each input used, two criteria have to be determined: 1. Price per unit of input (e.g. kg or hour). 2. Quantity used per unit of output. There are various methods which might be used for setting these standards. 
2.6.1 Price per Unit of Input The price per unit of input is usually set to reflect current market prices for the budgeted period. The difficulty with prices is that they may change due to external factors. A solution to this is that the budget or standard may be revised prior to performing variance analysis to take this into account. (Revisions of budgets are dealt with in Chapter 14.) 

2.6.2 Quantity of Materials Quantities may be determined by a "bill of materials" prepared by product design, the engineering department or a works foreman. Allowance may need to be made for an expected level of waste (i.e. if there is a normal loss in a production process, input quantities must be grossed up for the loss in order to achieve a required level of output). 

2.6.3 Direct Labour Hours For direct labour, "time and motion" studies of operations may be used to determine the most efficient production method. Time measurements determine standard hours for the typical worker to complete a job. 

2.6.4 Wage Rates Wage rates are determined by company policy/negotiations between management and unions. Sometimes, standards may have to be set before the annual wage negotiations have been concluded. 

2.6.5 Variable Overheads For variable overheads, a rate per unit of activity is calculated. The activity measure which exerts the greatest influence on costs is used - usually direct labour hours (although an alternative is to use machine hours).If there is no observable direct relationship between resources and output, past data may be used to forecast. 

2.6.6 Fixed Overheads Because fixed costs are largely independent of changes in activity, they are constant over wide ranges in the short term. Therefore, for control purposes, a fixed overhead rate per unit of activity is inappropriate. For inventory valuation purposes, IAS 2 Inventories requires standard fixed overhead rates; however, this is not a requirement for management accounting. 

3.1 The Principle 
The controllability principle is that managers should be judged only on things within their control. In a system of responsibility accounting, managers are given responsibility for particular areas of the organisation. At the end of the period, the performance of managers may be judged at least in part by: 
· variances which are attributed to their department; 
· differences between actual and budgeted revenues, costs and profits. 
Managers' remuneration may also be linked to this (e.g. bonuses could be paid if managers achieve their budgeted profit figures). It is essential, therefore, that the performance management system is fair.

Quiz: Controllability 
Rehan is the production manager of a factory making ball bearings. His performance is judged using variance analysis. The variance analysis for the last month has just been performed and includes the following: 
· An adverse materials price variance due to a change in the supplier. The supplier was changed because Rehan complained that the quality of the products sold by the previous supplier was substandard. 
· A labour idle time variance caused by two factors: 1. A strike lasting two days over pay. 2. A machine breakdown, meaning staff could not work until the machine was fixed. 
· A fixed overhead variance caused by an increase in factory rent. All rental contracts are dealt with by the company's legal department. 
Required: Discuss which of the events above (if any) are outside of Rehan's control and should, therefore, be ignored when assessing his performance. 

Answer:
Materials price variance. This variance was caused by Rehan's decision to switch supplier. He should, therefore, be held responsible for the variance. His decision to switch supplier may have been sensible and may reflect positively on some of his other variances, but the price variance was caused by Rehan. 
Idle time variance - the strike. There is no clear-cut answer to this. On the one hand, it could be argued that the strike was caused by the trade unions rather than by Rehan, so he was not to blame. But if Rehan, as production manager, is responsible for negotiating and agreeing wages, he may be responsible. Idle time variance - machine breakdown. At first, it may appear that the machine breakdown was outside Rehan's control. However, as production manager, Rehan is responsible for the maintenance of the machines in the factory and, therefore, any breakdowns. 
Fixed overhead variance. It seems relatively clear-cut that this particular expense is outside of Rehan's control. He has no responsibility for negotiating the rent. Therefore, he should not be "blamed" for this variance.

4.1 Importance of Flexed Budgets
At the start of the year, when a budget is prepared, estimates are made about the volume of sales and production. It is unlikely that the actual volume of sales and production will be the same as per the budget. This makes it difficult to compare actual performance against the budget, as they are based on different levels of activity. The budget can be flexed at the end of the period before this comparison takes place. The flexed budget is then compared to the actual results. This results in a more valid comparison, as like is being compared with like. 

Key Point 
Flexing the budget means that the budget is recalculated using the actual volume of sales and production. 

Example of Budgeted v Actual Results 
The following are extracts from a company's budgeted and actual results: 
| Budgeted production                             | 100 units         |
| Budgeted materials cost per unit                | $5                |
| Actual production                               | 200 units         |
| Actual materials cost per unit                  | $4                |
| The three relevant figures here are as follows: |                   |
| Original budget                                 | 100 x $5 = $500   |
| Flexed budget                                   | 200 x $5 = $1,000 |
| Actual cost                                     | 200 x $4 = $800   |
The $500 difference between the original budget and the flexed budget reflects the additional expected cost which resulted from higher-than-expected volume. The $200 difference between the flexed budget and the actual cost reflects that $200 less was spent on materials than expected, given the volume of activity. This variance is the more useful assessment of performance. 

4.2 Usefulness 
· The flexed budget is prepared at the same level of activity as actual output. 
· Actual revenues and costs are compared to what budgeted costs and revenues should be for the actual level of activity achieved. This highlights variances caused by higher or lower prices and costs than budgeted. 
· The difference between the original budgeted profit and the flexed budget profit shows the effect on profit of operating at a different activity level from plan. 

Summary:
· A standard cost is a planned cost for a product or service.
· When actual costs are compared against the standard, the resulting variances can be investigated to identify the cause. Standard costing is, therefore, an important element in financial control.
· Ideal standards, which assume perfect operating efficiency, are likely to be impossible to achieve in practice, so their use is demotivating.
· Attainable standards should be challenging but achievable under existing operating conditions.
· Controllability is the principle that managers should be evaluated only on that which they can control.
· When actual activity levels vary from budget, the original budget must be flexed in order to make meaningful the comparison with actual results. Flexing a budget means recalculating the budget based on the original budget assumptions, at the actual level of activity.



Chapter 12: Basic Variance Analysis
This chapter covers the following Learning Outcomes. D. Budgeting and Control 7. Performance analysis a) Analyse and evaluate past performance using the results of variance analysis. Note that this is a review of basic variance knowledge and interpretation from Management Accounting. Learning Outcome D7a also applies to advanced variance analysis (Chapters 13 and 14) 

1.1 Introduction 
This chapter revises the "basic variances" examined in Management Accounting and introduces the labour idle time variance. Various methods may be used to compute the basic variances shown here. Exam advice Although "basic" variances are examined in Management Accounting, they are also examined in Performance Management. However, at this level, there is more emphasis on understanding the possible causes.

Key point
Variances are favourable if they result in an increase in profits or adverse if they lead to a fall in profits. When computing a variance, it must be shown whether the variance is favourable or adverse.

1.2 Sales Variances 
1.2.1 Sales Volume Variance The sales volume variance shows the effect on profit of selling more or less than the budgeted quantity. Note that the activity below uses absorption costing principles. 

1.2.2 Sales Price Variance The sales price variance shows the effect on profit of selling at a higher or lower price than the standard.

1.3 Materials Variances 
1.3.1 Causes The total cost variance can be broken down into two further variances: 
· Price, if the price paid per kg is not at standard. 
· Usage, if more (or less) is used than should have been used for the production achieved. 

1.3.2 Materials Price Variance 
Materials Price Variance = Actual materials purchased at actual price - Actual materials purchased at standard price Materials; if positive, Adverse; if negative, Favourable.
Key point 
The materials price variance is based on the quantity of materials purchased during the period. If more materials are purchased than used, there will be an increase in inventory. 

1.3.3 Materials Usage Variance 
Exam advice When calculating usage and efficiency variances, always use the actual usage and not the actual purchases (if usage and purchases differ) and compare the actual usage to the standard usage for actual output, not the original budgeted usage. 

1.4 Labour Variances 
1.4.1 Causes 
The total labour cost variance can be broken down into three variances. 
1. Rate, if the hourly rate was higher or lower than expected. 
2. Idle time, if there were unproductive hours. 
3. Efficiency, if more (or fewer) hours were worked than should have been. In principle, the calculation of the labour rate variance is the same as the materials price variance, and the labour efficiency variance is the same as the materials usage variance. 

1.4.2 Labour Rate Variance 
Labour Rate Variance - Actual hours paid at actual rate -  Actual hours paid at standard rate Labour rate variance; if positive, Adverse; if negative, Favourable. 

1.4.3 Idle Time Variance (ii)

| Labour efficiency variance ($000)                          | 2      |

1.5 Variable Overhead Variances 
1.5.1 Causes The total variable overhead cost variance can be broken down into two variances where variable overheads are accounted for on a labour hour basis: 
1. Rate, if the actual rate incurred is non-standard. 
2. Efficiency, which is identical in cause to the labour efficiency variance but is calculated using the standard variable overhead absorption rate. 
Exam advice Assume that variable overheads are incurred during productive labour hours only (i.e. hours worked) unless told otherwise. 

1.5.2 Variable Overhead Rate Variance 
|     Variable Overhead Rate Variance                                          | $000 |
| Actual variable overhead cost                                                | 502  |
| Labour hours worked x standard variable overhead rate per hour (83,000 × $6) | 498  |
| Variable overhead rate variance ($000)                                       | 4    | Adverse

1.5.3 Variable Overhead Efficiency Variance 
|      Variable Overhead Efficiency Variance   | Hours  |
| Labour hours worked                          | 83,000 |
| Standard labour hours for actual production  | 84,000 |
| Difference                                   | 1,000  |
| x standard variable overhead rate per hour   | $6     |
| Variable overhead efficiency variance ($000) | 6      | Favourable

Key point 
As for the labour efficiency variance, the variable overhead efficiency variance compares actual hours worked with the standard labour hours for actual production. This recognises that if more/fewer hours are worked than the standard, variable overheads will increase/decrease because these are incurred when people are working. For example, machines will be running, so additional power costs will be incurred. 

1.6 Fixed Overhead Variances 
1.6.1 Causes Two possible variances arise: 
1. The expenditure variance compares the actual fixed cost with the original budget. If the company uses marginal costing, this is the only variance which is calculated. 
2. If the company uses absorption costing ONLY, a second variance is calculated, called the volume variance: - A "favourable" volume variance represents a correction to profits for over-absorption; - An "adverse" variance is a correction for under-absorption. 

1.6.2 Fixed Overhead Expenditure Variance 
|     Fixed Overhead Expenditure Variance | $000 |
| Actual fixed cost                       | 935  |
| Budgeted fixed cost                     | 825  |
| Fixed overhead expenditure variance     | 110  | Adverse
Key point 
Because fixed costs are fixed, the expenditure variance is the only real fixed overhead variance (i.e. that results in cash flow). 

1.6.3 Fixed Overhead Volume Variance 
|      Fixed Overhead Volume Variance     | Units  |
| Actual production                       | 56,000 |
| Budgeted production                     | 55,000 |
| Difference                              | 1,000  |
| x standard fixed overhead rate per unit | $15    |

1.6.4 Fixed Overhead Capacity and Efficiency Variances 
If the fixed overhead is absorbed using labour hours, the fixed overhead volume variance can be further analysed into two additional variances: the capacity variance and the efficiency variance. 
Fixed overhead volume variance -> Capacity variance Efficiency variance
The capacity variance compares actual labour hours worked with the original budget. If more hours were worked than budgeted, more fixed overheads are absorbed, so there will be a favourable variance. If fewer hours were worked than budgeted, there will be an adverse variance. Having more actual hours than budgeted is positive as it means the entity can produce more than expected. The efficiency variance is similar to the labour efficiency and variable overhead efficiency variances. It compares the actual labour hours worked with the standard labour hours for actual output.

2.1 A Reconcilation 
The operating statement is a formal reconciliation of budgeted profit (under absorption costing) to actual profit. The reconciling items are the individual variances.
Exam advice Unless explicitly told otherwise, assume that all inventories (raw materials and finished goods) are stated at standard rather than actual cost. 

Example of Reconciliation
Under Absorption Costing Required: Using the variances calculated in Activity 1, prepare an operating statement for the period under absorption costing.

3.1 Differences 
There are two differences between this and the total absorption approach just seen: 1. The only fixed overhead variance will be the expenditure variance. There can be no volume variances, as there is no attempt to absorb fixed overheads into production. 2. The sales volume variance must be re-calculated using standard contribution rather than standard profit.

4.1 Profit with Inventory at Actual Cost 
The actual profit with inventory valued at actual cost is: sales - costs + closing inventory

4.2 Variances 
When inventory is valued at actual cost, some of the current period's production cost variances are carried forward in the inventory value rather than being expensed in profit or loss (which happens when inventory is valued at its standard cost). 

4.3 Accounts 
For internal (management control) purposes, inventory is usually valued at its standard cost to highlight variances and to encourage any necessary remedial action to be taken. For external financial reporting (e.g. annual accounts), inventory is usually valued at its actual cost in accordance with IAS 2 Inventories. 

5.1 General Causes Variances may be caused by: 
· Planning errors (e.g. inaccurate standards) 
· Measurement errors (e.g. time recording errors) 
· Random factors (e.g. natural disasters) 
· Operational factors (e.g. management policies). 

Operational factors may indicate that the process is out of control, and it is these which are considered below.
Exam advice If asked to discuss or comment on the causes of variances, read the scenario carefully to identify the clues to the potential causes. Reasons that are irrelevant to the scenario or that contradict the information provided will not earn marks.

5.3 Interdependence of Variances 
Frequently, two or more variances will be caused by the same operational factor. It is necessary to consider the overall effect when considering any course of action. 
5.3.1 Examples 
· Purchase high-quality material: - Adverse materials price - Favourable materials usage. 
· Raise the selling price: - Favourable sales price - Adverse sales volume. 
· Use highly skilled labour: - Adverse labour rate - Favourable labour efficiency - Favourable variable overhead efficiency - Favourable fixed overhead efficiency. 

5.3.2 A More Complex Example 
Purchase high-quality material: 
· Adverse materials price 
· Favourable materials usage 
· Favourable labour efficiency 
· Favourable variable overhead efficiency 
· Favourable fixed overhead efficiency 
· Favourable sales price
· Adverse sales volume. 

Summary:
· Variance analysis is a detailed investigation into why actual profits differ from the budget; it compares the actual costs against the standards.
· Formulae for the variances are as follows:
    Notation:
      AQ = Actual quantity (AH = Actual hours)
      BQ = Budgeted quantity (SH = Standard hours)
      AP = Actual price (AR = Actual rate)
      SP = Standard price (SR = Standard rate)
      SMn = Standard margin
   Sale variances:
      Sales volume: (AQ − BQ) SMn
      Sales price: (AP − SP) AQ
      Materials variances:
      Price: (SP − AP) AQp
      Usage: (SQ − AQu) SP
  Labour variances:
      Rate: (SR − AR) AHp
      Idle time: (AHw − AHp) SR
      Efficiency: (SH − AHw) SR
  Variable overheads:
      Rate: (SR − AR) AHw
      Efficiency (SH − AHw) SR
  Fixed overheads:
      Expenditure: Budget − Actual
      Volume: (AQ − BQ) × Standard rate per unit or (SH – BH) SR (Absorption costing only)
      Capacity: (AH − BH) SR (Absorption costing only)
      Efficiency: (SH − AH) SR (Absorption costing only)
      Capacity + Efficiency = Volume
· The budgeted quantity in usage variances and standard hours in efficiency variances is always "budgeted for actual production".
· The only differences between variance analysis using absorption and marginal costing are:
    Sales volume variance is valued at standard profit per unit for absorption and standard contribution per unit for marginal.
    There is only one fixed overhead variance for marginal costing; the expenditure overhead.
· Variances could be caused by planning, measurement, random factors or operational factors. As far as investigating variances are concerned, operational factors are more important.

1.1 The Concept 
The basic variances examined in the previous chapter included variances for materials: the materials price and usage variances. The basic variances assumed that the production process used only one type of material. Clearly, most real world products use more than one material. The standard cost of a product assumes a specific quantity of materials is used. Actual production costs may differ from the standard in the following ways: 
· The prices paid for the materials may differ from the standard price. This will be reflected in the price variance. This is calculated in the same way as before, except that it is necessary to calculate price variances for each material used. 
· The materials may be used in different proportions to the standard. This may lead to a different average cost. This is reflected in a variance called the mix variance. 
· The standard may assume that there is some level of standard loss. The actual loss may be more or less than the standard loss. This is reflected in a yield variance. 

Example of Mix and Yield Variances 
A perfume is made by mixing essential oils with alcohol. Essential oils cost $15,000 per litre. Alcohol costs $10 per litre. In the standard, 1% of the liquid input is essential oil, and 99% is alcohol. If the production manager uses more oil and less alcohol, this would lead to a more expensive mix, as essential oil costs more than alcohol. This would result in an adverse mix variance. A normal loss of 37.5% of input occurs when making one litre of perfume. Therefore, the standard specifies using 1.6 litres of liquid to make one litre. If the production manager inputs 1.6 litres of inputs and produces more than 1 litre, this would result in a favourable yield variance. 

1.2 Calculating the Mix Variance 
A tabular approach best illustrates how to calculate the mix variance: 
|                       | Actual quantity used | Actual quantity in standard mix | Difference | Variance                |
|                       | litres/kg            | litres/kg                       | litres/kg  | S                       |
|                       | A                    | B                               | (A - B)    | (A - B) * standard cost |
| Material 1 Material 2 |                      |                                 |            |                         |
| Material 3            |                      |                                 |            |
| Total                 | X                    | X                               | 0          | $y                      |
Points to note: 
· Actual quantity used (column A) describes the actual amount of each material employed in production. 
· Actual quantity in the standard mix equals the total actual quantity used (total column A) multiplied by the standard proportions. The quantity totals for columns A and B will be the same. 
· Variance due to materials mix equals the third column multiplied by the standard price for each unit of input. 
This method determines variances as the actual quantity of each material less the standard quantity for each material (represented as column A less column B). Using more of a particular material than its standard means additional cost (i.e. an adverse variance if column A item is larger than column B). 

1.3 Calculating Yield Variance 
The yield variance compares actual output with the output expected based on the actual input. It amounts to the difference between expected and actual output multiplied by standard cost per unit. 
| Pro Forma Calculation    | Units                    |
| Actual output            | A                        |
| × litres/kg should yield | B                        |
| Difference               | (A - B)                  |
|                          | * standard cost per unit |
| Yield variance           | x			      |
The alternative tabular approach takes longer but is conceptually easier to understand. Firstly, it looks at the actual total quantity of materials, but this is split in the proportion of the standard mix. Secondly, it considers what the total quantity of materials used should have been for the actual output produced. Again, this is calculated in terms of the standard mix. 

|            | Actual quantity in standard mix | Standard quantity for actual output      | Variance 
             | litres/kg 		       | litres/kg              litres/kg 	  |  $      
											  | (B - A) * standard cost 	  |
|            | A                               | B              |     (B - A)		  |				  |

| Material 2 |                                 |                |                         |                               |
| 2          |                                 |                |                         |                               |
| Total      |                                 |                | 			  |        			  |

quiz: Materials Mix and Yield 
The Imperial Chemical Company (ICC) makes various chemicals. Chemical X is made by combining three substances in a furnace. The following is the standard cost of 100 kg of Chemical X: 
|            | $ per |
|	     | kg    | kg  | cost |
|            |       |     | $    |

| Material B | 25    | 1.3 | 32.5 |
| Material C | 25    | 3.0 | 75.0 |
|            | 125   |     | 160  |
The loss of 25 kg in production is expected due to evaporation. Variances are calculated every day. Yesterday's output of 1,300 kg was obtained from the following inputs:
|            | kg    |
| Material A | 850   |
| Material B | 300   |
| Material C | 350   |
|            | 1,500 |

Required: a. Calculate the materials mix variance. b. Calculate the yield variance. 

Answer:
a. Mix variance 
| Actual quantity used     | Actual quantity in standard mix (Worikng)| Difference | Variance |
| Material | kg            | kg                                       | kg         | $        |

| B        | 300           | 300                                      | 0          | 0        |
| C        | 350           | 300                                      | (50) @3    | (150)    |
|          | 1,500         | 1,500                                    | 0          | (115     |
The mix is adverse, because a higher proportion of the more expensive material (C) was used compared with the standard mix. WORKING Standard proportions are: 
Material A: 75/125 = 0.6 (i.e. 60%) 
Material B: 25/125 = 0.2 
Material C: 25/125 = 0.2 
These proportions are applied to the actual quantity used (1,500) to calculate the actual quantity in the standard mix. 

b. Yield variance 
125 kg of input yields 100 kg of output, so the standard yield is 80% (100/125). 
|                                      | kg    |
| 1,500 kg should yield (80%)          | 1,200 |
| Actual output                        | 1,300 |
| Difference (excess)                  | 100   |
| x standard cost per unit ($160 +100) | $1.60 |
| Yield variance ($)                   | 160   |
The yield variance is favourable because more output was achieved than expected, given the input.

1.4 Interpreting Material Mix and Yield Variances 
A favourable overall materials mix variance means the actual mix is cheaper than the standard mix. Cheaper materials have been substituted for more expensive ones. The perfume manufacturer in Example 1 would have a favourable mix variance if he used less than 1% of essential oils in the mix. While a cheaper mix saves money, it may imply poorer quality of the final product. This may mean a loss of customers in the long run. A favourable yield variance means that actual output exceeds the output expected for the given input units. This could be due to: less spillage due to production methods; or less waste due to quality of materials used as inputs. 

1.5 Inter-relationship Between Price, Mix and Yield Variances 
The materials price variance(s) may be outside the control of the production manager. For example, prices may be seasonal, based on a market rate, or negotiated by a buyer. Sometimes, a manager may obtain cheaper inputs from an alternative supplier. This will result in favourable price variances. However, if the cheaper materials are of lower quality, this may increase materials waste, resulting in an unfavourable yield variance. A manager who creates a favourable mix variance using an increased proportion of less expensive material may inadvertently cause an unfavourable yield variance. Exam advice When interpreting mix variances remember the controllability principle and manager performance assessment, as discussed in Chapter 11. 

1.6 Wider Issues Relating to Product Mix 
The materials mix may vary from standard for many products. 

Example of Varying Materials Mix 
Imagine cooking a meal at home. Perhaps you are following a recipe from a cookbook. Do you weigh the ingredients precisely so that your mix is exactly the same as the cookbook (the standard)? Or perhaps you vary them slightly based on your taste or simply because you do not measure everything precisely; you roughly estimate how much you have put in. You know that you will still have a meal, and hopefully, one that tastes good. 

The standard product mix was likely set after considering the following issues: 
· Balancing mix and yield - using a cheaper "mix" of materials often yields less. The standard mix attempts to minimise costs at an acceptable yield
·  Quality - a cheaper mix may lead to lower cost, but this may also lower the quality.

1.6.1 Reasons for Varying the Mix 
In practice, managers may move away from the standard mix for the following reasons: 
· The price of materials may change away from the standard, so one becomes relatively more or less expensive. 
· Inaccurate measurement of inputs due to carelessness or mistake. 
· Intentionally using a cheaper mix to get a favourable mix variance. 

1.6.2 Impact of Varying the Mix 
A cheaper mix will lead to a favourable mix variance. However, adverse effects may also result. 
· It may lead to a lower yield. When assessing the financial performance of the manager, the mix and yield variance need to be considered together. If the mix and yield variance added together give an overall favourable variance, that may be considered good from a financial perspective. 
· It may reflect lower output quality. In the longer term, this will lead to a fall in sales reflected in an adverse sales volume variance. The sales volume variance will take some time to show and may occur in a later period, making it difficult to assess management performance in the current period. 
Exam advice Always look for the whole picture when answering exam questions. A favourable mix and yield variance may result in an unfavourable non-financial impact (e.g. quality, customer satisfaction). 

1.7 Alternative Methods of Controlling Production Processes 
If production managers are evaluated on materials mix and yield variances, they may act to improve the measured variances at the expense of other important factors - particularly quality. To overcome this undesirable consequence, the performance evaluation of a manager should also consider additional measures. This could include rates of wastage or conversion rates of input. Customer satisfaction and quality are also important. However, measuring quality can be challenging, as it can be subjective. 

2.1 The Concept 
Where the company sells more than one product, the budget will include the budgeted quantity of each product sold. The actual sales can be compared with the budget, and the sales volume variance can be calculated. The overall sales volume variance can be analysed into two further categories: The sales mix variance compares the actual quantities of goods sold to the actual quantities sold at the standard mix. It shows the effect on contribution or profit of selling a different "mix" to the standard. If the products have different margins, the different mix will affect profits. . The sales quantity variance compares the actual quantity (units) of goods sold in the standard mix with the budgeted quantity sold in the standard mix. 

2.2 Calculating the Sales Mix Variance 
The best way to calculate the sales mix variance is to use a table: 
| Product      | Actual sales in units | Actual sales units in budgeted mix | Difference in units | Standard margin | Sales mix variance |
|              |                       |                                    |                     | $               | $                  |
|              | A                     | B                                  | A - B               | C               | (A - B) * C        |
| X            |                       |                                    |                     |                 |                    |
| Y            |                       |                                    |                     |                 |                    |
| Z            |                       |                                    |                     |                 |                    |
In principle, the calculation of sales mix variance is similar to the materials mix variance. It is the difference between actual product sales and actual total sales allocated in the budgeted product sales mix multiplied by the standard margin per unit. The standard margin is either standard contribution or profit per unit, depending on the costing method used. 
Exam advice Standard margin is either standard contribution per unit or standard profit per unit. If standard contribution, the variance is "sales mix contribution variance". If standard profit, the variance is the "sales mix profit variance". 


2.3 Calculating the Sales Quantity Variance 
The starting point for the quantity variance is actual sales, adjusted to the standard mix. This is then compared with budgeted sales, and the differences are multiplied by the standard margin. 
| Product        | Actual sales in budgeted mix | Budgeted sales | Difference | Standard margin | Sales quantity variance |
|                | (units)                      | (units)        | (units)    | $               | $                       |
|                | A                            | B              | A - B      | C               | (A - B) x C             |
| X	         |                              |                |            |                 |                         |
| Y 		 |                              |                |            |                 |                         |
| Z              | 		                |  	         |            |                 |                         |

2.4 Interpreting the Sales Mix and Quantity Variance 
2.4.1 Usefulness of Sales Mix and Quantity Variances When sales of various products are unrelated, the demand and price for each product will be considered separately to optimise profits. The budgeted sales mix has no significance. The sales price and volume variance calculated on a product-by-product basis should provide sufficient information for management to identify any products underperforming. Sales mix and quantity variances will not provide additional useful information. Analysing the sales volume variance into mix and quantity variances is only likely useful when sales of the various products are interrelated. The analysis may indicate that products are substitutes or complements. Similar products could be differentiated by package size or brand. In such situations, the mix of products may have been considered when the budget was prepared, and management will be interested in the sales mix and quantity variances. 

2.4.2 Meaning of Sales Mix Variances An adverse mix variance means that customers are buying less of the higher-margin products and are instead buying lower-margin products. It implies substitution of one product for another, rather than a reduction in the overall quantity of products sold.

Example of Contribution Margin 
A coffee drinker decides to stop buying an expensive coffee beverage from a coffeehouse chain and switches to a cheaper drink from the same chain but continues to buy the same number of cups of coffee. This would reduce the contribution margin of the coffee seller. 

2.4.3 Meaning of Sales Quantity Variance 
The sales quantity variance shows the actual quantity of goods sold against the budget. An adverse variance may be due to poor economic conditions or a new competitor. This variance identifies factors which affect sales of all the products. 2.4.4 Inter-relationships Between Variances The variances above are likely to be interrelated, so any analysis of variances should look at all the variances together rather than individually. For example: 
· Sales price and sales volume variances: a fall in selling prices for products would lead to an adverse price variance. However, if it also leads to higher demand for the products, the volume variance would be favourable. 
· Sales mix and quantity variances: an adverse sales mix variance may be due to customers switching to cheaper ranges or brands as these may be considered better value. If these "better value" products attract customers from other products too, this will lead to a favourable quantity variance. 


Summary:
· Materials mix variances measure the effect of using a different mix of inputs in the production process.
· Materials yield variances compare the actual output with the expected output, given the input material quantities and standard wastage.
· Sale mix variances show how changing the mix of products affected contribution.
· Sales quantity variances show the effect on budgeted sales of selling a higher or lower quantity.
· The budgeted sales mix has no significance when product sales are unrelated.
· Sales volumes of different products may be inter-related, for example, a sales decrease in one product may be compensated by a sales increase for a substitute product.
· Because of the relationship between price and demand, an unfavourable sales price variance will usually lead to a favourable volume variance (and vice versa).



Chapter 14: Planning and Operational Variances
This chapter covers the following Learning Outcomes. D. Budgeting and Control 6. Planning and operational variances a) Calculate a revised budget. b) Identify and explain those factors that could and could not be allowed to revise an original budget. c) Calculate, identify the cause of and explain planning and operational variances for: i) sales, including market size and market share; ii) materials; labour, including the effect of the learning curve. d) Explain and discuss the manipulation issues involved in revising budgets. 7. Performance analysis a) Analyse and evaluate past performance using the results of variance analysis. b) Use variance analysis to assess how future performance of an organisation or business can be improved. (d) Discuss the effect that variances have on staff motivation and action. (e) Describe the dysfunctional nature of some variances in the modern environment of JIT and TQM. (f) Discuss the behavioural problems resulting from using standard costs in rapidly changing environments. 

1.1 Principles 
At the end of a budget period, before comparing an organisation's actual performance against the budget, budgets may be revised to take account of environmental changes that were not anticipated when the budget was prepared. The reason for such revision is that because managers are judged on how they performed relative to the budget, it is unfair to use a budget that turns out to be unrealistic. The principles that should be applied when revising budgets are as follows: 
· If something occurred during the budget period that was outside the control of the manager meant that the budget became unrealistic, the original budget should be revised. 
· Management should not revise budgets to hide inefficiencies. 
· Senior management should approve only appropriate revisions.

Quiz: Budget Revisions 
The budget for an airline for the year ended 31 December 20X1 was prepared in October 20X0. Since the budget was prepared, the following events occurred: 
· The price of oil increased 25% on world markets. This caused airline fuel prices to rise. Fuel accounts for 25% of the airline's costs. 
· Due to a strike, the airline could not operate for four weeks of the year. There was no revenue during this period. 
· The airline lost an additional two weeks of revenue due to the eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in Iceland and the associated ash cloud. 
Required: For each event above, discuss which should result in budget revisions and which should not. 

Answer:
Budget revisions should be made regarding the increase in fuel costs and the volcano ash - as these are clearly outside of the control of management. The lost revenue from the strike is less clear. On the one hand, the strike could be "blamed" on the management for poor industrial relations. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to revise the budget, and management should be "blamed" for the loss of revenue during this period. On the other hand, it could be argued that it was outside management's control because unions called the strike. 
Exam advice Although the answer above may appear a little "woolly" in that it does not reach a definite conclusion, the real world often presents situations with no "right" answer. Both sides of the argument need to be given in response to questions of this nature rather than a quick conclusion.

2.1 Problems of Traditional Variance Analysis 
Traditional variance analysis compares: ACTUAL PERFORMANCE versus EXPECTED 
Management should consider revising the standards for expected performance: 
· If the actual environment differs from what was anticipated when the original standard was set; or 
· Even if the environment has not changed, the benefit of hindsight shows that an unrealistic standard was used (e.g. ideal standard). The factors to consider in deciding whether to revise a standard are essentially the same as whether to revise a budget (as above). The variances calculated by comparing actual performance against the revised standard are referred to as operational (or operating) variances. The calculation of these is the same as the method used to calculate traditional variances; the only difference is that a revised standard is used. 
· The difference between the revised standard and the original standard is the planning variance (or budget revision variance). These variances can relate to any element of the standard product specification or to sales/production volumes. 

Planning variance - arises when an original budget is revised with the benefit of hindsight (i.e. ex-post meaning "after the fact"). 
Operational variance - arises when actual performance differs from a revised standard. 

2.2 Planning Cost Variances 
There are various methods of calculating planning variances. The following approach starts with the traditional variance (e.g. a material price variance), which is then analysed into planning and operational variances. Exam advice This is the preferred approach for the Performance Management exam. 

2.2.1 Materials Price and Labour Rate 
The approach to calculating the materials price and labour rate variances is the same, so these two variances are dealt with together here. 
· For materials, the references to quantity are to quantities of materials; 
· For labour, the quantities are labour hours. 

Traditional Price/Rate Variance
|                                  | $            |
| Actual quantity * Actual price   | x            |
| Actual quantity * Standard price | X            |
| Price variance                   | x 		  |
If the standard price is subsequently revised, the traditional variance can be analysed into planning and operational variances as follows: 
Planning Price Variance 
This shows the effect of revising the standard cost by comparing the standard cost of actual materials using the old and new standard cost:
|                                             | $            |
| Actual quantity * Original standard price   | x            |
| Actual quantity * Revised Standard price    | X            |
| Planing price variance                      | x            |
This is adverse if the revised standard price is higher than the original standard price. 

Operational Price Variance 
|                                             | $            |
| Actual quantity * Actual price  	      | x            |
| Actual quantity * Revised Standard price    | X            |
| Operational price variance                  | x            |
This is favourable if the actual price is less than the revised standard price.

Quiz: Materials Price Variances 
The standard cost of Material X is $4 per kg. During the month, 10,000 kg were purchased at a total cost of $42,500. 
Required: a. Calculate the traditional material price variance for the month. b. The purchasing manager argued that the original standard cost in the variance report was unrealistic. Market prices of Material X rose considerably during the month, and it has been agreed that a more realistic standard cost would have been $4.50 per kg. Calculate the planning price and operational price variances for the month. c. Comment on how the operational price variance provides a fairer indication of the performance of the purchasing manager than the traditional price variance. 

Answer:
a. Traditional price variance 
|                                                            | $      |
| Actual materials at actual price                           | 42,500 |
| Actual materials at standard price (10,000 * $4)           | 40,000 |
| Materials price variance (adverse)                         | 2,500  |

b. Planning and operational variances 
|                                                            | $      |
| Actual materials at original standard price (10,000 * $4)  | 40,000 |
| Actual materials at revised standard price (10,000 * $4.5) | 45,000 |
| Planning price variance (adverse)                          | 5,000  |
| Operational variance                                       |        |
|                                                            | $      |
| Actual materials at actual price                           | 42,500 |
| Actual materials at revised standard price (10,000 * $4.5) | 45,000 |
| Operational price variance (favourable)                    | 2,500  |

c. Comment on the purchasing manager's performance The price variance reflects, to some extent, the performance of the purchasing manager: 
· If the purchasing manager is effective, he may be able to negotiate better prices. 
· If price variances are adverse, however, this suggests that the manager is not managing to achieve the standard price and is therefore not "doing a good job." 

The traditional price variance is $2,500 adverse, suggesting that the purchasing manager has not performed well. However, this would not be a fair conclusion. The actual cost of materials was higher than the standard because the market prices of Material X increased after the standard was set. This increase was outside the manager's control, so he should not be held responsible. Therefore, the traditional variance does not reflect the purchasing manager's performance fairly. The operational variance compares the performance against a standard that has been updated to reflect the change in the market price. It provides a more reliable indicator of performance. In this case, the operational price variance is favourable, which suggests that the purchasing manager has performed well. He has managed to obtain a price below the market price. Because this is more reliable, it can be said to be fairer.

2.2.2 Materials Usage and Labour Efficiency 
The approach to calculating the materials usage and labour efficiency variances is the same, so they are dealt with together here. 
Traditional Usage/Efficiency Variance
|                                              | Kg/Hours, etc |
| Actual quantity used                         | X             |
| Standard quantity for actual output          | X             |
| Difference                                   | X             |
| At standard price/rate per unit/hour         | $x            |
| Materials usage (labour efficiency) variance | $x            |

Planning Usage/Efficiency Variance 
|                                                     | Kg/Hours, etc |
| Original standard quantity for actual output        | X             |
| Revised standard quantity for actual output         | X             |
| Difference                                          | X             |
| At original standard price/rate per unit/hour       | $x            |
| Materials usage/labour efficiency planning variance | $x            |
This is adverse if the revised standard quantity is greater than the original standard quantity.

Quiz: Labour Efficiency Variances and operational variances
A standard cost was set for a new product at the start of a month. The standard for the labour component was 0.25 hours at $10 per hour. In the last month, the actual output of the product was 1,000 units, and 320 labour hours were worked. At the end of the month, it was agreed that the factory accountant had been a little unrealistic in setting a standard of 0.25 hours per unit. A more appropriate standard would have been 0.3 hours per unit. It has been agreed that the standard will be revised to this amount. There was no idle time and no learning curve effect. 
Required: a. Calculate the traditional labour efficiency variance. b. Calculate the labour efficiency planning and operational variances. c. Comment on how the operational efficiency variance gives a more appropriate indication of the performance of the factory manager than the traditional efficiency variance. 

Answer:
Operational efficiency variance
| a. Traditional labour efficiency variance                                     | Kg/Hours, etc |

| (b) Planning on operational efficiency variances Planning efficiency variance | Hours         |
| Original standard hours for actual output                                     | 250           |
| Revised standard hours for actual output (1,000 x 0.3)                        | 300           |
| Difference                                                                    | 50            |

| Labour planning efficiency variance (adverse)                                 | $500          |
| Operational efficiency variance                                               | Hours         |
| Actual hours worked                                                           | 320           |

| Labour operational efficiency variance (adverse)                              | $200          |

c. Fairness of operational efficiency variance The traditional efficiency variance is $700 adverse. This would reflect unfavourably on the factory manager as the actual factory hours were almost 30% more than the standard. It has been claimed, however, that the standard was overly optimistic. Using an inappropriate standard would certainly not be fair, so the traditional variance would not be a fair performance measure. The standard has been revised to make it more realistic. The operational variance compares the actual performance against the revised standard and should, therefore, be a fairer indicator of the performance of the factory manager. This is still adverse, but the actual hours worked are only 6.7% higher than the revised standard, so the situation is not as bad as the traditional variance indicates. Care must be taken when revising such standards to ensure they are not adjusted to hide poor performance. It would be necessary to challenge the assertion that the original standard was overly optimistic and to ascertain how the revised standard time of 0.3 per unit was reached.

| Materials actually used:     | 86,000 kg at $3    |
With hindsight, a better standard would have been 3.75 kg per unit at $2.80 per kg. Required: a. Calculate the traditional variances: i. Price variance; ii. Usage variance; iii. Overall material variance (price + usage). b. Analyse the price variance into planning and operational. c. Analyse the usage variance into planning and operational. 

Answer:
a. Traditional price and usage variances     
|                                               | $        |
| Price variance (2.50 - 3.00) 86,000           | 43,000 A |
| Usage variance (22,000 x 4 - 86,000) $2.50    | 5,000 F  |
| Total variance                                | 38,000 A |

b. Planning price and operational price variances 
| Planning variance                                               | $        |
| Actual materials at original standard price (86,000 * 2.5)      | 215,000  |
| Actual materials at revised standard price (86,000 * 2.8)       | 240,800  |
| Planning price variance (adverse)                               | 25,800   |
| Operational variance                                            | $        |
| Actual materials at actual price (86,000 * 3)                   | 258,000  |
| Actual materials at revised standard price (86,000 * 2.8)       | 240,800  |
| Operational price variance (adverse)                            | 17,200   |
| Note: The sum ($25,800 + $17,200) equals the traditional price variance of $43,000

c. Planning usage and operational usage variances 
Planning usage variance 
|								| Kg       |
| Original standard quantity for actual output (22,000 × 4)     | 88,000   |
| Revised standard quantity for actual output (22,000 x 3.75)   | 82,500   |
| Difference                                                    | 5,500    |
| At original standard price per kg                             | $2.50    |
| Materials planning usage variance (favourable)                | $13,750  |
| Operational usage variance                                    |          |
|                                                               | Kg       |
| Actual quantity used                                          | 86,000   |
| Revised standard quantity for actual output                   | 82,500   |
| Difference                                                    | 3,500    |
| At original standard price per kg                             | $2.50    |
| Materials operational usage variance (adverse)                | $8,750   |
Note: The sum ($13,750 - $8,750) equals the traditional usage variance of $5,000 favourable. This revised analysis still indicates that there is inefficiency on the part of the buying department, but also suggests that there could be more efficient usage of materials. Compare this with the traditional analysis, which suggested a more serious inefficiency in buying (i.e. $43,000 adverse price variance) coupled with efficient usage of materials.

2.3 Learning Curve and Labour Variances 
Where a learning curve applies, standard costs based on the cost of producing the first unit of a product may quickly become out of date, meaning that the variances will become meaningless. To adjust for this, the "standard hours for actual production" in the labour efficiency variance should take into account the learning curve (see Chapter 10).

Quiz: Learning Curves and Variances 
Martin Co developed a new product. It set a standard labour cost based on the expected time to make the first unit of the product, which was 100 minutes. A 90% learning rate is expected to apply, and the budgeted cost per hour of labour time is $12 per hour. This learning rate was not incorporated into the standard. The actual time taken to make the first four units was 350 minutes and the cost was $80.

2.4 Market Size and Market Share Variances 
2.4.1 The Concept A traditional sales volume variance may result from: 
· a market size variance, which arises because the size of the market was different from expected due to a change in the external environment (e.g. economic growth); or 
· a market share variance, which arises because the share of that market was different from the budget (e.g. due to effective advertising). If the actual market size for a product is known, the sales volume variance can be analysed as follows: Sales Volume Variance SALES VOLUME PLANNING VARIANCE Sales managers can control the market share variance but cannot control the market volume variance. Therefore, any bonus for the sales manager should be linked to the market share variance. 

2.4.2 Market Size Variance

| Market size variance                         | $X		|
Exam advice If marginal costing is used, multiply the differences by the standard contribution per unit. If absorption costing is used, multiply the differences by the standard profit per unit.

Quiz: Sales Planning and Operational Variances 
Acme has a sales budget of 1,795 units at a unit contribution of $20.00. This is based on the company maintaining a 5% market share. The market for the industry was estimated to be 35,900 units. Actual sales volumes were as follows: Acme 1,850 units, Industry 37,500 units.
Required: Calculate for Acme: a. the traditional sales volume variance; and b. the market size and market share variance. 

Answer:
a. Sales volume variance (1,850 - 1,795) $20 = $1,100 Favourable 

b. Planning and operating sales volume variances table 
| Market size variance                    | Units  |
| Budgeted sales quantity                 | 1,795  |
| Revised budgeted quantity (37,500 × 5%) | 1,875  |
| Difference                              | 80     |
| × Standard contribution per unit        | $20    |
| Market size variance                    | $1,600 | (F)
| Market share variance                   | Units  |
| Actual sales quantity                   | 1,850  |
| Revised budgeted quantity               | 1,875  |
| Difference                              | 25     |
| x Standard contribution per unit        | $20    |
| Market share variance                   | $500   | (A)
The market size variance is favourable, meaning that the actual market size was greater than expected. This is a planning variance and is outside of the control of Acme Co. The market share variance is adverse because actual sales were below the budgeted market share of the actual market.

2.5 Advantages and Disadvantages 
Advantages:
· Distinguishes between those variances caused by bad planning or unavoidable factors and those resulting from operating factors. 
· Adverse operating variances provide feedback control on processes which need correcting. 
· Planning variances can be used to update standards to current conditions. 
· Motivation may improve if managers know they will only be assessed on variances under their control (i.e. operational variances). 

Disadvantages:
· Extra data requirements (e.g. market size). 
· More time-consuming. 
· Managers may claim that all adverse variances have external causes and all favourable variances have internal causes (i.e. manipulation of revised standards). 
· Operational managers may claim that all adverse variances are due to poor standard setting at the planning stage (but take credit for all favourable 

2.6 Manipulation 
From the previous discussion, it should be apparent that budgets and standards prepared at the start of the year may need revision at the end of the year if they are inappropriate because of factors that occurred outside of the organisation's control. Managers who have not achieved their budgets/targets may try to hide adverse variances by revising their budgets and standards. Therefore, to prevent manipulation, there must be strict rules to ensure that budget revisions are only made when appropriate. Revisions should only be permitted when there is independent, verifiable evidence (e.g. a published price index for a change in market price). 

3.1 Effect on Staff Motivation and Action Standard costing and variance analysis may be used as part of the performance evaluation of managers and staff. Variance analysis will, therefore, have some effect on motivation. 
· As for budgets, a challenging target can motivate managers and staff to work harder, compared with having no target. 
However, there are many potential problems related to the use of variance analysis: 
· If managers use variance information insensitively, morale may suffer. Employees (workforce and supervisors) should be congratulated on tasks well done, but management by exception tends to focus on what has gone wrong. Employees berated or disciplined for adverse variances may attempt to conceal them or take actions to ensure that the variances within their control are favourable, which may not be in the company's best interests. For example, a rush to increase productivity at the end of the budget period to avoid an unfavourable labour efficiency variance may reduce the quality of output. 
· Accurate preparation of standards can be difficult. For example, workers may operate below their ability during standard-setting runs to build "slack" into the standard. 
· Labour quantity standards and efficiency variances make two assumptions that may not hold true: 1. Output increases if workers speed up (i.e. the pace of production is dictated by labour). However, the volume of output may be influenced more by the processing speed of equipment. 2. Labour is a variable cost. However, the cost of a workforce may be fixed. Undue emphasis on efficiency can result in an excessive build-up of work in progress and finished goods inventories. 

3.2 Variances and Performance Evaluation This chapter and the three preceding chapters have mentioned the use of variances to evaluate performance. This section provides comprehensive guidance on this aspect of variance analysis. 

3.2.1 Identify the Cause of the Variance Possible causes of traditional variances were discussed in Chapter 12, and Chapter 13 gave reasons for materials mix and yield variances. In the real world (and in examination questions), there may be other causes. The first stage in using variances to evaluate performance is to understand what caused them. Having identified the cause of a particular variance, it is worth identifying whether other variances were also affected. For example: .
· A favourable materials price variance may have been caused by buying cheaper materials, but this may also have resulted in an adverse materials usage variance. 
· It would be meaningless therefore to say that the favourable price variance was "good" and that the adverse usage variance was "bad". 
All variances caused by a common factor should be considered together. It may be worthwhile to add the variances together (treating favourable variances as positive and adverse variances as negative) to appreciate the total financial impact. Exam advice Variances that are related to a common factor should be evaluated together. 

3.2.2 Identify Who Is Responsible 
It may be that variances are being used to assess the performance of a particular manager (e.g. a factory manager). Managers should only be judged on variances that are within their control. Variances are usually the responsibility of the following departments and their managers: 
· Materials price variance - the purchasing department. However, look for signs that the purchasing department may have been put under pressure to buy from a particular supplier. Or, if the purchase was requisitioned at very short notice, the purchasing department may have been unable to obtain a favourable price that it might have had otherwise. 
· Labour rate variances - this depends on who decides how much to pay particular workers. It could be the human resources department or the factory manager. 
· Labour efficiency variances are usually assumed to be the responsibility of the person who supervises the workers - this could again be the factory manager. However, these variances may also be related to the rate variance - a higher grade of labour will generally lead to an adverse rate variance, but the labourers might work more efficiently.
· Material usage variances are also associated with a production manager. However, variances may also have been caused by the purchase manager buying a quality of material different from the standard. 
· Mix and yield variances are typically controlled by the production manager, who supervises the production process. However, these may also be affected by the quality of materials used, which could be the responsibility of the purchasing manager. 
· Overhead variances will be the responsibility of the appropriate managers - equipment maintenance expenditure, for example, would depend on the maintenance manager. 

3.2.3 Consider Whether the Standard Was Fair 
As previously explained, a standard should be revised if it becomes outdated or is otherwise unreasonable (e.g. it was a poor estimate). Operational variances are generally a more reliable indicator of performance than traditional variances. 

3.2.4 Non-financial Factors 
Variances reflect only the financial view. Non-financial factors such as quality may be equally important, but these factors are ignored by variances. This is a significant limitation of variance analysis. If variances are favourable, this means costs are being kept under control. However, if this is at the expense of quality, the favourable variance may have some negative consequences. 

Example of Non-financial Factors A past exam question involved a company that manufactured soup. The production manager had been told that his performance would be judged on the reported variances. He had successfully kept costs down, reporting large favourable mix and yield variances. From a financial point of view, this seemed positive. On the other hand, the sales manager was angry that customers were complaining about the quality of the soup. This was related to the production manager diluting the soup to reduce costs, which also reduced quality. In the long term, this threatened to lead to a fall in demand, leading to a fall in profits. 

3.2.5 Improving Future Performance After identifying the causes of variances, appropriate action can be taken to ensure that future performance improves. For example: 
· Including non-financial factors as well as variances in managers' appraisal systems. 
· Regular review and updating of variances to reflect changes in the external environment. 
· Using target costing to identify ways to reduce costs further. 

3.3 Relevance of Variances in the Modern Environment of JIT and TQM Many writers have argued that variance analysis is not relevant in the modern, rapidly changing business world and that it can lead to dysfunctional behaviour for these reasons: 
· Use of a standard costing system may lead to an overemphasis on quantitative elements of performance. It is important that qualitative performance is not neglected (e.g. customer satisfaction, employee morale, innovation), particularly in a total quality management environment. 
· Just-in-time (JIT) and flexible manufacturing systems aim to provide more tailored production to meet customers' needs. There may, therefore, be less standardisation of production, which makes comparison with a standard less meaningful. 
· JIT purchasing systems emphasise forging close, long-term relations with suppliers. Under such a system, input costs will likely be known with certainty in advance, so there will be no price variances. 
· Traditional standard setting is based on a company's own costs and procedures. This may be too inward- looking where the company operates in a rapidly changing, competitive market. 
A more modern approach is benchmarking, which also takes into account the practices of other organisations in the industry (i.e. external information). 

3.4 Behavioural Problems in Rapidly Changing Environments 
The use of standard costing and variance analysis can have adverse effects on behaviour in a rapidly changing environment.
· Merely meeting standards may be insufficient to ensure a company's survival in a competitive environment. It may be necessary to focus on trends in variances which aim for continual improvement. 
· Standards provide an internal focus to management. In a rapidly changing environment, an external focus would be more appropriate. 
· New products come online more frequently. There may be learning curves associated with these. Standards which fail to reflect learning curves may not set an appropriate target. They could be too easy, which would not challenge staff, or too difficult, which would be demotivating. 

Summary:
· Actual performance is compared with budgets at the end of each budget period. Before performing this comparison, it may be appropriate to revise the budget if it turns out to be unrealistic in retrospect or if factors outside the control of the relevant manager occurred which make the original budget inappropriate.
· Standards also may be revised before performing variance analysis:
    Operational variances compare actual performance against a revised budget or standard.
    Planning variances compare the original standard with the revised standard for actual output.
· Traditional cost variances can be analysed into planning and operational as follows:
    Price (rate) planning variance:
    (Actual quantity * Original standard price) − (Actual quantity * Revised standard price)
    Operational price (rate) variance:
    (Actual quantity * Actual price) − (Actual quantity * Revised standard price)
    Planning usage (efficiency) variance:
    (Revised SQ for actual output − Original SQ for actual output) * Original standard price
    Operational usage (efficiency) variance:
    (Actual quantity − Revised SQ for actual output) * Original standard price.
· The sales volume variance can also be analysed into a market size (planning) variance and a market share (operational) variance.
· A revised budgeted sales quantity is found by multiplying the budgeted market share with the actual market size.
    Market size variance is (Original budget quantity − Revised standard quantity) * Standard contribution/profit per unit.
    Market share variance is (Revised standard quantity − Actual sales quantity) * Standard contribution/profit per unit.
· The use of standard costing and variance analysis aims to improve operational efficiency. Managers need to be aware of the potential adverse effects of variance analysis on behaviour.


Chapter 15: Performance Measurement
This chapter covers the following Learning Outcomes. E. Performance Measurement and Control 1. Performance analysis in private sector, public sector and not-for-profit organisations a) Describe, calculate and interpret suitable financial performance indicators (FPIs) for example profitability, liquidity, efficiency and gearing. b) Describe, calculate and interpret suitable non-financial performance indicators (NFPIs). c) Analyse past performance and suggest ways for improving financial and nonfinancial performance. d) Explain the causes and problems created by short-termism and financial manipulation of results and suggest methods to encourage a long-term view. e) Discuss the issues organisations face by favouring short-term financial gain over long-term sustainability. g) Discuss the difficulties of target setting in qualitative areas. 

1.1 Main Objectives of Performance Measurement 
As part of an organisation's corporate strategy planning, directors will define the organisation's objectives. These objectives may be organised into a hierarchy of objectives, the performance hierarchy. Performance measurement aims to show how successfully the organisation achieves its objectives. Therefore, performance indicators are part of the organisation's control system. The main objectives of a performance measurement system are to: 
· design measures which are consistent with the strategy for each level of the organisation; 
· set objective, quantifiable targets based on those measures rather than subjective appraisal; 
· develop reward schemes based on managers' performance against the targets; and 
· judge managers fairly, i.e. on outcomes they control. 

1.2 The Performance Hierarchy 
The idea of the performance hierarchy was introduced in the chapter on budgeting. As a reminder, the objectives of an organisation are often based on a performance hierarchy. Typically, the hierarchy consists of the following: 
· Mission - the main reason for the existence of the organisation. 
· Corporate objectives - more concrete objectives, stating what the mission means in practical terms to the primary stakeholder groups (e.g., to increase the company's market value by more than a given percentage over a specific period of time). 
· Subsidiary objectives - other objectives of the organisation may relate to various stakeholder groups (e.g. to reduce the amount of pollution by a given percentage). 
· Unit objectives - these are objectives for the operating departments (units) of the organisation. They should contribute to the subsidiary and corporate objectives. 

1.3 Hierarchy of Objectives 
Because there is a hierarchy of objectives, there will also be a hierarchy of performance measures. Performance targets and measures will be set at all levels within the organisation. In a well-designed system, these targets and measures will be consistent with the organisation's overall goals. 

2.1 Introduction Traditional performance measurement considered only financial measures. This was deemed appropriate because it was assumed that the primary objective of all organisations was to maximise shareholder wealth. Focusing on financial measures seemed a natural way to achieve this objective. Much of the material covered already in earlier chapters relates to FPIs, in particular: 
· Budgeting; 
· Standard costing and variances; 
· Activity-based costing; 
· Specialist management accounting techniques. 
This section introduces additional, widely used ratios for financial performance evaluation. 

2.2 Returns on Capital 
Measures describing returns to the various providers of capital include return on equity (ROE) and return on capital employed (ROCE): 
Return on equity = Profit after tax/(Share capital + reserves) * 100 
Return on capital employed = Profit BEFORE interest and tax/Capital employed * 100 
Capital employed is equivalent to total assets less current liabilities = total equity plus long-term debt. Where opening and closing capital are known, an average is usually used. Exam advice It is important is to match the profit figure with the appropriate capital. If profit is after interest, divide by equity. If profit is before interest, divide by equity plus long-term debt, because that profit will be shared between providers of debt and equity finance. 

2.2.1 Meaning of Return on Capital Employed ROCE shows the return generated on the long-term capital invested in the company. This can be compared with other companies in the same industry sector or to the company's cost of capital. Comparing companies in other sectors does not provide valid information. Service industries, for example, require less capital than manufacturing industries and will show a greater return on capital employed for each dollar of profit. 

2.2.2 Methods to Improve Return on Capital Employed ROCE is validly improved by investing in projects that generate a higher return on capital. Other methods of increasing ROCE that are not actually improvements include: 
· The use of different accounting policies may affect profits and capital employed. 
· Delaying investment in new plant and machinery or reducing investment in intangible assets. As the existing non-current assets depreciate, their carrying amount (net book value) falls, reducing the capital employed and improving ROCE. Such measures may harm the organisation in the long term. 

2.3 Profit Margins 
Profit margins relate profit to revenue. There are different profit margins because there may be more than one profit figure reported in the statement of profit or loss (gross profit, profit before interest and tax, etc.). The most commonly used are the gross and net profit margins. 

2.3.1 Gross Profit Margin Gross profit is calculated by deducting the costs of buying or making the company's products from sales revenue. Therefore, it reflects the performance of the company's products. 
Gross profit margin = Gross profit/Revenue 8 100

2.3.2 Meaning of Gross Profit Margin 
A falling gross profit margin over time means that: 
· either the selling price at which the company sells its goods is declining, or 
· the cost of making or buying those goods is increasing, but those increases cannot be passed on to customers. 
In either case, a prolonged decline is a bad sign. It suggests that the company's products or services are losing popularity, which raises concerns for the viability of the business. Gross profit margins may also reflect an organisation's pricing strategy. 
· Companies that use a premium pricing strategy are likely to have a high gross profit margin. 
· Companies that aim to sell for a low price, to achieve a larger volume of sales are likely to have a low gross profit margin. 

2.3.3 Methods to Improve Gross Profit Margins Gross profit margins may be improved by: 
· Introducing new products that are popular with customers. These can be sold for a higher margin. 
· Using target costing to reduce the cost of sales (target costing is in Chapter 3).
· Reclassifying direct expenses as administrative would increase the gross profit margin but not improve overall profitability. Gross profit depends on the company's policy for classifying expenses as direct or administrative. Changes in such policies should be viewed with suspicion. 

2.3.4 Net Profit Margin 
Net profit describes profit after deducting all costs. Net profit margin shows overall profits as a percentage of revenue. 
Net profit margin = Net profit after tax/Revenue * 100

2.3.5 Meaning of Net Profit Margin Net profit, sometimes called "the bottom line ", shows overall profits (after deducting all costs) as a percentage of revenue. 
· Although this gives a broad indicator of the organisation's performance, further analysis should consider that the causes of changes must be investigated. 
· Net profit margin reflects the following three areas: 1. The underlying popularity of the company's products and services (this is also reflected in the gross margin). 2. The amount of control the company has over administrative-type expenses. 3. Costs of debt financing. This will depend partly on whether the company has changed the amount of debt and partly on whether interest rates have changed. 

2.3.6 Ways to Improve the Net Profit Margin 
· Introduce new products that are popular with customers. These can be sold for a higher margin. 
· Use target costing to reduce the cost of sales. ¥ Increasing sales volume should increase net profit margins if a high portion of the company's costs are fixed (e.g. in a training company). 
· Better control over administrative expenses (e.g. salaries). ¥ Using less debt finance. 

2.4 Asset Turnover Ratio 
The asset turnover ratio relates revenue to the amount of capital invested in the business: Revenue/Capital employed 
It indicates whether or not the capital invested is appropriate, given the value of sales revenue. Excessive levels of capital invested will lead to a low turnover ratio. The asset turnover ratio can be improved by: 
· Selling non-current assets that are surplus to requirements. 
· Recognising impairments and writing down the value of the assets. (Arguably, this is merely financial engineering as it does not improve actual performance.) 
· Improving working capital management, for example by collecting receivables more quickly or reducing inventory levels through better inventory management. 

2.4.1 Analysis of Return on Capital Employed 
Return on capital employed ratio (see s.2.2) is the product of the operating profit margin and the asset turnover: 
ROCE = Operating profit margin * Asset turnover 
Profit before interest and tax/Capital employed = Profit before interest and tax/Revenue * Revenue/Capital employed
This relationship can provide insights into the ROCE for a particular business. For example, if a business is experiencing a decline in ROCE, this could be due to: 
· a decline in the asset turnover ratio; or 
· a fall in the profit margin; or 
· a decline in both of the above. 
Finding out which of these factors gave rise to the decline will point the analyst in the right direction to find the underlying causes. 

2.5 Liquidity Ratios 
Liquidity ratios measure the ability of the organisation to meet its liabilities as they become due (e.g. suppliers, interest on bank loans, overdrafts). Creditors could take legal action against a company that fails to pay its liabilities when due, which, in the worst case, could lead to liquidation of the company. Many profitable companies occasionally face liquidity problems. Operating cash flows represent the ultimate measure of liquidity. If a company generates positive operating cash flows sufficient to replace non-current assets, it is less likely to experience liquidity problems. 

2.5.1 Current Ratio The purpose of the current ratio is to measure the adequacy of current assets to meet current liabilities (without having to raise additional finance). A ratio of less than 1 means current liabilities exceed current assets Current ratio = Current assets (at period end) Current liabilities (at period end) 

2.5.2 Inventory Holding Period The purpose of the inventory holding period is to measure the amount of time inventory is held before it is sold, measured in days. The shorter the period, the lower the holding costs of inventory and the faster inventory can be converted into cash. 
Inventory Holding Period (days) = 365 * Average Inventory ($)/Cost of Sales($) 

2.5.3 Receivables Collection Period 
The purpose of the receivables collection period is to measure the amount of time receivables are held before they are collected, measured in days. The shorter the period, the lower the financing costs of receivables, and the faster receivables can be converted into cash. Shorter periods also indicate a lower risk of bad debt. 
Receivables Collection Period (days) = 365 * Average Receivables($)/Total Credit Sales($) 

2.5.4 Payables Payment Period 
The purpose of the payables payment period is to measure the amount of time payables are held before it is they are paid, measured in days. Payables can be used as a form of interest-free financing. The longer the payables payment period, the lower the financing cost. Longer periods also indicate more cash retention. However, this needs to be balanced against the risk of losing access to payables financing if suppliers are no longer willing to provide it. 
Payables Payment Period (days) = 365 * Average Payables($)/Total Credit Purchases($)  

2.5.5 Quick Ratio (Acid Test Ratio)
The quick ratio measures immediate liquidity (by eliminating the least liquid asset, inventory, from current assets). 
Quick ratio = (Current assets - Inventory at period end)/Current liabilities at period end
Sometimes referred to as the "acid test" ratio, the quick ratio is a more conservative version of the current ratio. A low or declining ratio may indicate an inability to meet its liabilities as they come due. This could result from insufficient cash flows to pay its suppliers on time or a cash shortage due to investments in non-current assets. 

Example of Quick ratio
An international food retailer, which regularly reports a current ratio of about 0.3, illustrates the fallacy of using a single current ratio target to indicate satisfactory liquidity. The company has low inventory, as food only lasts a few days. It has few receivables, as most of its sales are for cash. It invests cash balances in non-current assets and holds low cash balances. Also, the company does not pay its suppliers for three months, so it has large payables balances. Far from indicating liquidity problems, the company uses its suppliers as a free source of financing. 

2.5.6 Ways to Increase Liquidity Ratios 
Acceptable ways of increasing (i.e. improving) liquidity ratios include: 
· Using long-term finance (loans and equity) to finance acquisitions of non-current assets. This is usually done to match the financing period with the useful life of the non-current asset. 
· Generating positive cash flows to repay short-term liabilities on time. 
Liquidity ratios may also be increased by adjusting year-end balances ("window dressing"); however, this is not a genuine improvement.

Quiz: Quick ratio (window dressing)
The following are extracts from the statement of financial position of a company: 
|             | $000  |
| Receivables | 900   |
| Cash        | 500   |
| Payables    | 1,000 |
Required: a. Calculate the quick ratio. b. Re-calculate the ratio if $400,000 of payments are made just before the year-end. 

Answer:
a. Quick ratio = $1.4m/$1m 1.4
b. Quick ratio = ($1.4m-0.4m)/($1m-0.4m) = $1m/$0.6m = 1.7

2.6 Gearing 
Gearing (or "leverage") measures the portion of a company's finance provided by debt. The advantage of debt is that it is a relatively cheap source of financing: 
· Providers of debt require a lower return than providers of equity finance because they face less risk, as they receive preferential repayment in the event of default. 
· Interest on debt is also a tax-deductible expense, which further reduces the cost of debt. 
However, companies with too much debt (gearing) increase the risk of being unable to repay the debt's interest and principal. 

2.6.1 Gearing Ratios 
Gearing ratios measure the proportion of long-term borrowed funds (which pay a fixed return) to equity capital (shareholders' funds) and provide information about a company's financial risk due to debt burden. Two gearing ratios are commonly used: 
Equity/Debt * 100 (gives gearing as a percentage) OR 
Debt/Equity plus debt * 100 

Example of Gearing 
The following are extracts from the statement of financial position of three different companies: 
|                                                                                                   | A          | B                 | C               |
|                                                                                                   | $          | S                 | S               |
| Shares capital and reserves                                                                       | 10,000     | 3,000             | 7,500           |
| Long-term debt                                                                                    | =          | 7,000             | 2,500           |
| Capital employed                                                                                  | 10,000     | 10,000            | 10,000          |
|                                                                                                   | No gearing | 70% highly geared | 25% low gearing |

2.6.2 Meaning of Gearing 
A gearing ratio in isolation means very little. It is only useful if the gearing of the organisation is compared with industry averages or with other companies in the same business area to determine whether or not the gearing is too high. 
· In industries with stable profits, companies can sustain higher gearing levels. High gearing ratios increase risk in companies where profits fluctuate because a fall in profits may mean the company cannot repay interest on its loans. 
· An increase in gearing over time may reflect changes in the level of debt deemed acceptable to the finance director. Alternatively, it may indicate that insufficient cash flows cause the company to borrow money to finance short-term operations. 

2.7 Interest Cover 
Interest cover shows how much the return on debt (interest) is covered by profit (before tax because interest is an allowable expense for income tax purposes). Lenders use this measure to determine the vulnerability (sensitivity) of interest payments to a fall in profit. 
Interest cover = Profit before interest and tax/Interest 

2.8 Approach to Financial Performance Evaluation Exam Questions 
2.8.1 Comments Not Calculations 
Few marks will be available for simply calculating ratios in performance evaluation questions. Candidates need to show that they can comment on what the numbers and calculations show about how the organisation has performed. 

2.8.2 Approach Before writing anything, spend a few minutes reviewing and analysing the information. The following is a suggested approach to this planning time: 
· Review the "big picture" - look at revenue growth, profit growth and any other major trends visible in the data. 
· Calculate a limited number of ratios that you think are necessary to investigate further any trends identified in the analysis (e.g. if revenues have grown, but profits have not changed, it may be worth calculating gross profit margins to determine if this is the cause of the sluggish profits). 
· If capital is given, calculate the return on capital employed, as this can indicate how well the organisation provides a return on the capital invested. 
· Review the information given in the scenario and look for clues which might explain the trends. Information such as "the company operates in a competitive environment" might explain falling gross profit margins. 

Having planned in this way, start to write your answer. Comment on each trend identified. Comment means: 
· State what happened (e.g. profits increased by 20% between quarter 1 and quarter 2). 
· State why this happened using any relevant information provided in the scenario to help identify why (e.g. revenue increased by 10%, and many of the company's costs are fixed, which has led to a 20% rise in profits). 
· Link this to other related items. For example, investment in new machinery that increases capacity or capability may cause a significant increase in depreciation. On the other hand, retaining and maintaining legacy (old) machinery may cause increasing repair spending. 
· Express an opinion (e.g. an increase in profits of 20% is impressive given that the company is operating in a competitive environment). It is a good idea to show any ratio calculations separately (e.g. in an appendix). This looks professional. This appendix may be in the spreadsheet answer space for constructed response questions in PM computer- based exams.

Quiz: Financial Performance Measurement 
Well-heeled ("WH") is a children's shoe shop in a major capital city suburb. The shop was started in 20X7, quickly establishing a reputation for high-quality children's shoes. There are no other shoe shops in this particular suburb, but there is a large shopping centre in the next suburb, 5 km from WH, with several children's shoe shops. The retail space next door to WH became vacant at the start of 20Y0. Because WH's existing landlord also owned this, WH decided to rent this space, expanding the area of the shop from 40 square meters to 60. The company employs one full-time shop assistant, and starting in 20Y0 hired an additional assistant to work on Saturdays. The owner of WH also works in the shop but does not take a salary for her time. The country in which WH is located was severely affected by an economic downturn in the first half of 20Y0 but started to recover in the second half of 20YO. Inflation in 20X9 and 20Y0 was 2%. The statements of profit or loss for the years 20X9 and 20YO are presented below: 
|                     |        | 20X9    |        | 20Y0    |
| $                   | $      | $       | $      |
| Sales               |        | 180,000 |        | 240,000 |
| Less: Cost of sales |        | 120,000 |        | 168,000 |
| Gross profit        |        | 60,000  |        | 72,000  |
| Less expenses       |        |         |        |         |

| Light and heat      | 1,000  |         | 1,200  |         |
|                     |        | 33,200  |        | 48,000  |
| Net profit          |        | 26,800  |        | 24,000  |

Required: Assess the financial performance of the shop using the information above. 

Answer:
Sales revenues increased by one-third (33%) between 20X9 and 20Y0. This is impressive as the shop is only 5 km from a big shopping centre (a significant competitor). It is also remarkable, given that the economy was in recession during the first half of 20Y0. The cause of the increase in sales could be due to price increases or volume increases. Given the fall in the gross profit margin (see following), it would seem more likely that sales volumes have risen. This reflects the reputation that the shop is gaining locally for high-quality products. 

Gross profit margins fell from 33.3% in 20X9 to 30% in 20Y0. This suggests that sales prices have fallen or supplier cost increases have not been passed on to customers. This is probably because, during a recession, the business recognises that customers are more price-conscious. Prices may also have been lowered to gain more customers, which may be related to the increase in revenues. If gross margins continue to decline, this may cast doubt on the viability of the business in the long term. In this case, however, it seems more likely that the fall in margins will be a temporary phenomenon caused by the recession. 

Staff costs have increased by 50%. This is likely due to the employment of an additional shop assistant in 20Y0. Because the assistant works only on Saturdays, however, we would not expect that alone to account for a 50% increase. The existing shop assistant was probably given a pay rise to compensate for being busier now that the shop size has increased. Staff costs as a percentage of revenue have risen from 11.1% in 20X9 to 12.5% in 20Y0. The owners need to ensure that they do not let this cost continue to rise above the level of sales, or this will reduce profitability. 

Rent also has increased due to the larger space occupied. The cost per square metre has remained constant at $180 per square metre per year, which shows that the landlord has not increased the rent, possibly due to the recession. A corresponding increase in revenue has not matched the 50% increase in space, but it does leave the shop space to grow in future years. 

Marketing has increased by 20%. Because revenue has increased by 33.3%, however, it seems that the marketing effort is producing good results. 

Light and heat have increased by 20%. This is good given the 50% increase in the size of the shop. In practice, light and heat are items outside businesses' control, as the prices are set by large energy providers with little competition. Net profit declined despite the increase in revenues. 

Net profit margin was 10% in 20YO compared to 14.9% in 20X9. This margin fall is mainly due to the fall in gross margins (had gross margins remained constant, profits would be $8,000 higher) and partly due to additional staff costs and rent. Hopefully, gross margins may increase in future years as the economy recovers. The staff costs and rent should remain relatively stable in the coming years, allowing an increase in revenues without an increase in such expenses. The company owners would probably be disappointed that profits fell despite a significant revenue increase. However, the business is in an excellent position to benefit from an economic recovery in 20Y1.

3.1 Financial Performance Indicators (FPIs) 
3.1.1 Inherent Weaknesses Traditional performance measurement relied almost exclusively on financial measures. However, since the 1980s, many companies recognised inherent weaknesses in focusing only on financial factors. 
· FPIs may lead to excessive focus on cost reduction. Short-term cost reductions may be achieved at the expense of long-term performance due to the effect on staff morale, quality and other factors. 
· FPIs ignore the drivers of business success. The things which drive business success are: - Quality; - Delivery; - Customer satisfaction; - After-sales service. 
· FPIs can be affected by using different accounting policies and "window dressing" to make the performance look better. Possible solutions to this are to use: - Profit growth over several years; - Encouraging managers to consider the factors that drive long-term success (that may otherwise be sacrificed for short-term gains) using non-financial performance measures. Since the 1980s, many companies have started developing non-financial performance indicators. 

Key Point 
Although many organisations are obsessed with financial performance measures, NFPIs drive businesses forward in the long run. FPIs may measure success, but they do not ensure success. 

3.1.2 Short-Termism and Financial Manipulation 
Many organisations use financial performance measures such as profit and ROCE. Managers are often given bonuses or better promotion prospects if the organisation achieves these financial targets; failure to achieve them may adversely affect promotion prospects. Therefore, managers may take a short-term view and concentrate on achieving the next set of financial targets, ignoring the longer term. This short-termism in performance management is often called short- termism (or myopia). Short-termism may exist for the following reasons: 
· Receiving a bonus now seems much more attractive than earning it in the future. 
· If managers expect to be promoted, or there is high management turnover, they may view that future financial performance is irrelevant to them, as they will be working elsewhere by then. 
· Shareholders may take a short-term view of performance and will be disappointed if the targets of the current period are not met. This is particularly relevant to listed companies that fear failure to meet the quarterly earnings expectations of stock market investors. 
There is nothing wrong with improving the current year's profits. However, some actions to improve financial performance in the current period will harm the business in the longer term. For example: 
· Failing to invest in worthwhile projects (i.e. that would generate profits over several years) because: - They may reduce profits in the shorter term; - The initial investment in capital assets and increase in depreciation leads to a lower ROCE in the early years of a project. 
· Failing to invest in "value building" activities (e.g. research and development, training, advertising and marketing) that may bring long-term benefits but would reduce reported profits in the current financial periods (because they cannot be capitalised under financial reporting standards). 
· Cutting expenditure activities that would lead to better quality of a product. In the long term, this may lead to losing customers and revenue. 
· Reducing headcount, which may lead to a reduction in the quality of customer service. 
· Recruitment freezes and cutbacks in training and development during economic downturns, which means that the organisation does not develop the skills and knowledge needed to compete when the economic climate improves. 
· Salary freezes that may lead to increased staff turnover. High staff turnover can lead to the loss of "corporate knowledge" (tacit knowledge and skills employees hold that the organisation has not developed a system to retain) and high costs of recruiting and training new staff. Short-termism may also increase the risk of financial manipulation, which can take many forms of earnings management (e.g., the recognition of revenue and expenses), profit smoothing or manipulation of key accounting ratios (e.g., misclassification of debt or equity). 

Key Point 
Short-termism can be a particular problem in the public sector because governments typically set budgets annually with no longer-term plans being set. 

The use of NFPIs can mitigate short-termism in the following ways: 
· Measures of the quality of a product or a service should ensure managers do not cut back on these. 
· Measures relating to staff satisfaction (e.g. staff turnover) should reduce cutbacks in staff-related expenditure. 
· A more balanced view of performance should focus on the drivers of longer-term growth. 

3.1.3 Short-term Financial Gain vs. Long-term Sustainability 
The financial impact of focusing on short-term financial gain will erode an organisation's value-creation ability in the long term. Also, any adverse effects on the external environment may be detrimental to the organisation's ability to generate returns or meet its objectives in the future. For example: 
· A hotel delays investment in refurbishing rooms and facilities. In the short term, the smaller asset base figure inflates traditional performance measures (e.g. ROCE), seemingly indicating strong financial performance. However, in the long run, the attractiveness of the hotel declines, reducing its ability to demand sustainable revenues from customers and reducing margins and profitability. Eventually, the hotel's customer ratings are downgraded, making it difficult to increase prices without major refurbishment and marketing expenditure. 
· A company builds a factory without considering the needs and demands of the local community regarding pollution control, provision of affordable housing, traffic management and contribution to the community. In the short term, ignoring these external factors leads to higher profits, as the company focuses on generating income from operations. However, in the long run, increased pollution, unaffordable housing and traffic congestion are likely to lower the overall attractiveness of the area to potential talent and contribute to increased stress and health concerns among employees. These issues increase operating costs, particularly in healthcare, time off due to illness and recruitment. A significant risk includes the involvement of the local community's government representatives in instituting laws and regulations designed to reduce the effect of the firm's negative externalities. The negative publicity may affect customers' perception of the company, reducing the margins it can charge as they consider alternatives with more sustainable credentials. 

3.2 Key Performance Indicators 
Many companies identify critical success factors (CSFs) at the strategic level. 
· Organisations should only identify a few critical success factors, usually from their mission statement, objectives and strategy. 
· Key performance indicators (KPIs) measure how well an organisation meets its critical success factors. 
Critical success factors - an area where an organisation must perform well if it is to succeed. 
Critical success factors - those product features that are particularly valued by a group of customers, and, therefore, where the organisation must excel to outperform the competition. Johnson, Scholes, and Whittington 
Key performance indicator (KPI) - a quantifiable metric that measures the achievement of a goal or objective. KPIs should be: 
· specific (e.g. measure profitability rather than "financial performance", a term which could mean different things to different people); 
· measurable (e.g. number of customer complaints rather than "level of customer satisfaction"); and 
· relevant (i.e. they measure achievement of a critical success factor). 

Example of Key Performance Indicators 
Vodafone Group plc, the British multinational mobile telephone operator, monitors the following key performance indicators quarterly: 
· Mobile data growth and network quality (Mbps) 
· Broadband and converged consumer customers (million) 
· Data ad 4G data users (million) 
· Mobile contract churn 
· loT ("Internet of Things") SIM growth 
· M-Pesa (African payments platform) customers 

3.3 Operational NFPIs 
Having set NFPIs consistent with the organisation's strategic objectives, non-financial performance measures can be set at all levels of an organisation.

Quiz: Manufacturing NFPIs 
Suggest some possible non-financial performance measures which might be used in a manufacturing organisation to measure the following attributes: a. Product quality; b. Product delivery; c. Customer satisfaction; and d. After-sales service. 

Answer:
| Attribute                 | NFPI                                                                                      |
| (a) Product quality       | · Percentage of items rejected by quality control · Number of items returned by customers |
| (b) Product delivery      | · Percentage of customer orders delivered on time · Waiting time from order to delivery   |
| (c) Customer satisfaction | · Number of customers returning · Number of complaints                                    |
| (d) After-sales service   | · Waiting time  · Number of complaints · Customer surveys to measure their satisfaction.  |

3.4 Advantages of NFPIs
· Usually easier to calculate than financial reports, they can be provided much more quickly (e.g. at the end of each shift). 
· More flexible as organisations can come up with any measures appropriate to their objectives. 
· Less affected by changes in financial policies than financial measures. 

3.5 Ways to Improve Performance Indicated by NFPIs 
3.5.1 Quality Indicators Many organisations use quality improvement programmes to improve the measured quality of products or services. Such programmes typically include quality control and quality assurance: 
· Quality control focuses on measuring the quality of the products and comparing this against a predetermined standard. Typically, this involves quality inspectors. 
· Quality assurance means having procedures to ensure good quality. This might include redesigning processes, using better-quality materials and "quality meetings" during which staff members suggest ways to improve quality.

Quiz: Non-financial Performance  
Ben's Grub Co (BG) operates a food takeaway and delivery service based in Homeland. Customers buy ready meals by walking into one of BG's takeaway shops or placing an order for home delivery by telephone or Internet. Home deliveries are delivered by motorcycle. BG's mission is to provide excellent-quality food by buying only the freshest products and excellent service by recruiting and retaining the best staff. Its meals are of good quality and aimed at busy middle- class professionals with high disposable income levels. A performance measurement report focusing on non-financial measures has been used for several years. The report for the last two years contains the following information, with industry average figures, where available: 
|                                         | Year 1  | Year 2  | Industry average |
| % of orders delivered in 30 minutes     | 86%     | 81%     | 80%              |
| Quality of meals - rating by            |         |         |                  |
| independent reviewer (out of 10)        | 8       | 7       | 6                |
| Average customer rating (out of 5)      | 4.3     | 3.7     | 3                |
| Number of meals sold                    | 62,000  | 70,000  |                  |
| Number of online sales                  | 18,000  | 27,000  |                  |
| Number of website visits                | 400,000 | 450,000 |                  |
| Number of new meals launched            | 3       | 5       |                  |
| Number of complaints                    | 500     | 760     |                  |

The industry average conversion rate (number of online sales as a percentage of website visits) is 4.5%. 
Required: Assess the non-financial performance of BG for the last two years based on the information provided. 

Answer:
BG aims to provide excellent service and excellent quality to busy middle-class professionals. Such customers probably pay a higher price but expect a superior level of quality for both food and service. BG must keep the quality level high; otherwise, customers may be lost. Delivery is an essential aspect of quality of service and is measured by the percentage of orders delivered in 30 minutes. This has fallen from 86% in Year 1 to 81% in Year 2. This may be because more meals have been sold, putting additional pressure on the delivery staff. Although Year 2 delivery performance is still better than the industry average, this decline must be stopped. Management needs to investigate the reasons for the fall and take remedial action (e.g. hire additional motorbike drivers). The quality of meals also has declined, according to an independent rating. In isolation, the decline of only 1 point (from 8 to 7) may not be a cause of great concern, as such ratings are very subjective and may depend on several factors. However, the decline in customer ratings from 4.3 to 3.7 corroborates the suggestion that food quality has declined. Both ratings are above the industry average, but this is to be expected, given the focus on excellent quality. Management should spend time checking that the quality of the food is improved and try to find out why these ratings are declining. The number of meals sold has increased by 13% (from 62,000 in Year 1 to 70,000 in Year 2). This appears to be due to the increase in online sales, which have increased by 9,000 (i.e. 50%). This suggests that the website is attracting more customers. Some existing customers are likely switching to online ordering from more traditional methods. Receiving online orders is an essential tool for the business, and it has done well to exploit this. The overall increase in sales is also a good sign; even if the quality of food and service has declined, this has not been reflected yet in the sales figures. The number of website visits has increased by 11.1 % (from 400,000 to 450,000), which shows that more people are discovering the website. It is not stated whether any Webmarketing activities might have increased its visibility (e.g. paying search engines such as Google a fee for ensuring that Ben's Grub is listed towards the top of any search for "takeaway food" or having links placed on other websites). The "conversion rate" is the number of online sales as a percentage of website visits. As this shows the percentage of visits that lead to a sale, it measures how well the website persuades visitors to place an order. In Year 1, the conversion rate was 4.5%, rising to 6% in Year 2. The Year 1 rate was the same as the industry average; the Year 2 rate shows an increase above this. This indicates that the website is relatively good at encouraging potential customers to place an order. The number of complaints has risen by 52%. As a percentage of meals sold, this was 0.8% in Year 1 and 1.1% in Year 2). Although the proportion of complaints appears low, the increase is a cause for concern. It could be related to the reduction in the percentage of meals delivered in less than 30 minutes or the apparent decline in the quality of meals. The number does not seem significantly large, so hopefully, the situation can be remedied to avoid the loss of customers. 
Staff turnover is well below industry averages in both years and has declined over the two years. This is a positive sign that staff members enjoy working for BG. It is essential in service industries that staff members are motivated, as any lack of motivation may lead to customers experiencing a poor level of service. Low staff turnover also means that the costs of training new staff are reduced, and customers benefit from better service from experienced staff. BG has explicitly recognised the importance of staff in its mission statement (where it mentions that it wishes to recruit and retain the best staff), and it seems that the company is indeed managing to keep its staff. There has been a slight increase in employees from 20 in Year 1 to 22 in Year 2. Staff utilisation can be calculated by dividing the number of meals sold by the number of staff. This was 3,100 in Year 1 and rose slightly to 3,182 in Year 2. Although higher staff utilisation is good from a financial point of view, it should not be too high, as this may lead to staff being overworked and the quality of service declining. Given the other signs of a fall in the quality of service, management should seriously consider employing additional staff. Overall, BG has increased sales (particularly online sales), implying a successful year. However, there are signs that service and food quality are declining. Therefore, management must take action to ensure that this is stopped before customers are lost.

3.5.2 Customer Service 
Customer service is vital in service industries, but the level of after-sales service is also critical in manufacturing industries. Ways to improve performance in customer service include: 
· Training to ensure staff understand the importance of customer service. 
· Incentives to staff to reward improvements (e.g. "employee of the month" rewards and prizes for good performance). 

3.6 Target Setting in Qualitative Areas 
· The budgeting and standard costing chapter dealt with problems in setting financial targets. Most issues relating to setting financial targets also apply to qualitative areas. In qualitative areas, however, there may be additional complications. 

3.6.1 Qualitative Areas of Performance 
The most critical qualitative areas of performance tend to be: 
· Quality of product or service · Customer satisfaction 
· Delivery 
· After-sales service. 
These are the areas that organisations wish to measure using NFPIs. 

3.6.2 Difficulties of Setting Targets for Qualitative Areas When setting targets for qualitative areas, the following difficulties will be experienced: 
· Identifying the drivers of improved performance. Rather than simply measuring customer satisfaction, for example, it is better to determine what staff can do to achieve greater customer satisfaction and then set targets based on these. However, it is often difficult to identify these drivers, and some judgement will be required. 
· Many qualitative factors cannot be measured. For example, how do you measure "friendliness of staff"? 
· Staff behaviour in response to set targets. Staff will aim to achieve the targets but perhaps not in the expected manner. 
· Setting the level of difficulty of the targets. Excessively difficult targets will demotivate staff, while too easy targets will not improve performance.

Example of Call Centre 
A call centre recently introduced a target of two minutes per call to increase the number of calls handled. It was discovered that staff hung up on customers after two minutes to avoid a variance. 


Summary:
· Performance measurement shows how well an organisation achieves its stated objectives.
· An organisation can rank its objectives in a hierarchy from its mission, strategic objectives and critical success factors down to lower-level goals to support strategic objectives.
· Traditional performance measurement systems focus on financial measures. There are many different financial performance indicators. The most important categories are: Return on capital; Profit margins; Asset turnover ratios; Liquidity ratios; Gearing ratios; Interest cover.
· Financial measures exclude essential factors that drive the financial performance of an organisation. NFPIs should be used in addition to financial measures to overcome the inherent weaknesses of financial measures.
· A critical success factor is a performance outcome that an organisation requires to achieve success.
· NFPIs can measure qualitative aspects of performance (e.g. product quality, customer satisfaction and staff morale).

1.1 Introduction 
Chapter 15 examined the weaknesses inherent in relying exclusively on financial performance indicators (FPIs) and the benefits of using non-financial performance indicators (NFPIs) to supplement these. NFPIs became very popular around the turn of the century. Two problems arose, however: 
· Some organisations went too far, ignoring or giving insufficient attention to financial performance. This is inappropriate. The primary objective of a commercial organisation is to maximise shareholder wealth. 
· Organisations developed too many NFPIs, many of which conflicted and were confusing. In response to these problems, Kaplan and Norton developed the balanced scorecard approach. The objective of the balanced scorecard is to provide top management with an integrated set of performance measures. The balanced scorecard looks at performance from four different perspectives: 1. Customer perspective - how do our customers see us? 2. Internal business process perspective - at what must we excel? 3. Learning (or innovation) and growth perspective - how can we continue to grow and change in the modern dynamic business environment? 4. Financial perspective - how do we look to shareholders? The four perspectives should complement each other. If customers are satisfied, for example, this should lead to increased revenues and profits, which improve the financial perspective. 

1.2 Balanced Scorecard Philosophy 

1.2.1 Setting Measures and Performance Targets
Objective - a specific, measurable statement of what will be done to achieve goals within a defined time frame. (Although the terms objectives and goals are widely used interchangeably, a goal tends to be more of a longer-term aspiration.) 
Performance measure - a quantitative or qualitative characterisation of performance used to evaluate progress toward an objective.

"Balanced" is used because managerial performance is assessed under all four perspectives. For each perspective, management needs to identify: 1. Objectives - what are the main objectives? 2. Measures - how can the performance be measured against the objectives? 3. Targets - what targets should be set for each measure? 4. Initiatives - what actions could be taken to improve performance? 

1.2.2 Leading and Lagging Indicators Kaplan and Norton were interested in the cause and effect aspects of performance measurement. 
· Lagging (downstream) indicators show the effect of decisions long after they are made. The balanced scorecard refers to financial measures as a lagging indicator because that performance results from past decisions. 
· Leading (upstream) indicators drive future financial performance. These are the non-financial performance indicators relating to customers, internal business processes and learning and growth. 

1.2.3 Importance of Strategy Kaplan and Norton also realised that many performance measures chosen by organisations were inconsistent with their organisational strategy. A company's objectives for the four areas should reflect its mission and strategy, and appropriate measures should be selected to reflect these objectives. Many companies began to use the balanced scorecard not simply as a performance measurement tool (its original objective) but to help clarify and manage strategy. 

1.3 Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages of the balanced scorecard approach to performance measurement include: 
· It leads to a wider view of performance rather than concentrating on the financial aspects of performance. Managers are unlikely to be able to distort the performance measure as poor performance is difficult to hide using multiple measures. 
· It takes a long-term perspective of business performance and links performance measurement to the organisation's objectives and strategy. This ensures that what is measured is relevant to the strategy and objectives of the organisation. 
· Using only a small number of KPIs ensures that management can concentrate on the most critical aspects (i.e. "what gets measured gets done") and avoid confusion arising from having too many performance indicators. 
Of course, there are potential difficulties: 
· Introducing the balanced scorecard would require training and a culture change. Managers and staff may initially be sceptical. 
· Identifying the most appropriate measures may be difficult. 
· Obtaining the data to determine whether some measures have been achieved may be problematic. 
· The balanced scorecard focuses only on the needs of two stakeholders - owners and customers; it ignores the needs of other groups, such as employees. 
· Suppose management is not sufficiently selective in its choice of appropriate KPIs. In that case, managers have to analyse many KPIs, some of which may conflict with each other, and determine which gives the most significant results. 

Example of The Balanced Scorecard 
For low-cost airlines (e.g. Ryanair and easyJet) to stay competitive, management must develop performance measures which support the carriers' strategy and focus on critical aspects of performance. The following measures have been developed to reflect important aspects of the low-cost carrier's business model: 
| Objective                                       | Measure                                                             |
| Business process perspective                    |
| Punctuality                                     | % of flights on time                                                |
| Effectiveness of direct selling                 | Enquiry/booking conversion rate                                     |
| Innovation and growth                           |                                                                     |
| Route network development                       | Time taken to build traffic to breakeven load factor for new routes |
| Number of routes withdrawn                      |
| Development of individuals Customer perspective | Expenditure on training                                             |
| Internal promotion rates                        |
| Customer satisfaction                           | Customer ratings (service/VMF)                                      |
|                                                 | Customer complaints/compensation payments                           |
| Customer loyalty                                | Repeat business                                                     |
|                                                 | Switching to other airlines                                         |
| Financial perspective                           |                                                                     |
| Profitability                                   | Return on capital employed                                          |
| Financial stability                             | Gearing                                                             |
| Utilisation                                     | Load factors                                                        |
| Low costs                                       | Cabin crew cost per seat per km                                     |


2.1 Characteristics of Service Industries 
As mentioned in Chapter 3, four specific characteristics of services make performance measurement in service industries more difficult than in manufacturing industries. 1. Simultaneity (inseparability) - services are consumed as they are produced. 2. Heterogeneity (i.e. lack of homogeneity), also called variability - each service provided could be unique because people are involved, and the quality of service cannot be standardised. 3. Intangibility - the service may have no physical aspects (e.g. smell, touch, sound, visual representation, etc.). As a consequence, the service provider may find it challenging to identify the service aspects customers value. Customers may also find it difficult to communicate what they value about the service to the service provider. 4. Perishability - services cannot be stored. A service must be provided when the customer wants; it cannot be prepared in advance. To have sufficient resources to meet peak demand, an organisation will likely have unused capacity at non-peak times. 

2.2 Fitzgerald and Moon's Building Block Model 
2.2.1 Purpose of the Model Fitzgerald and Moon designed the Building Block model as a framework for service companies to use in developing a performance evaluation system linked to reward schemes for managers. There are three "blocks" - dimensions, standards and rewards. 

DIMENSIONS: Financial performance, Competitiveness, Quality, Innovation, Flexibility, Resource utilisation.
STANDARDS: Ownership, Achievability, Equity.
REWARDS: Clarity, Controllability, Motivation. 

2.2.2 Dimensions 
Dimensions are the aspects of performance which must be measured. There are six dimensions in the Fitzgerald and Moon model. Organisations need to identify performance measures based on these six dimensions. (Similar to the four perspectives in the balanced scorecard model.) The six dimensions are: 1. Financial performance 2. Competitiveness 3. Quality 4. Resource utilisation 5. Flexibility 6. Innovation. 

Financial performance and competitiveness are the results, while quality, resource utilisation, flexibility and innovation are the determinants. If the organisation performs well in the determinants, this will lead to good performance in the results. Example 2 Car Dealer's Performance Additional research by Fitzgerald discovered a large car dealer network in the UK that used the following performance dimensions and measures: 
· Financial performance: Measurement of profitability by dealer, with the information disseminated to the dealer owners. 
· Competitiveness: Market share from published industry data and measurement at the business unit level using new car registrations by postcode. 
· Quality of service: A combination of measures, including formalised management inspections, mystery customer transactions, and post-transaction customer assessment through feedback questionnaires. Contact with customers is repeated regularly on an annual basis to continue developing long-term relationships with the customer. 
· Resource utilisation: Sales per employee, among other operational measures for cost and asset utilisation. 
Flexibility and innovation are not directly measured at this organisation, although there are specific formalised structures to manage flexibility (e.g. dealing with peak season or sales/maintenance surges from customers). A point is made that, in the absence of formalised measures for flexibility and innovation, these dimensions are discussed during business planning. 

2.2.3 Standards 
Three principles should be applied in setting targets for managers: 1. Ownership - managers should take ownership of (believe in) the targets. Managers who participate in setting targets will be more likely to believe in them. 2. Achievability - targets should be challenging but achievable; otherwise, managers will dismiss them rather than be motivated to achieve them. Owing to the principalagent problem, those responsible for results will always push for easier targets. 3. Equity - the organisation should maintain a realistic level of difficulty for its standards across all business areas and be fair and unbiased in its performance assessment. 

2.2.4 Reward Schemes 
Reward schemes may be linked to performance by paying managers bonuses if they achieve targets. Three principles apply: 1. Clarity - employees must understand the performance measurement scheme. 2. Motivation - bonuses should motivate staff to achieve the targets. 3. Controllability - managers' performance evaluations should only measure factors they control. 

Example of Building Block Model 
SmartC is a package delivery company located in Maxland, a developing country. Since its formation 50 years ago, it has become one of the country's largest and most successful shipping companies. Its mission is "to exceed customers' expectations in the transfer of packages by offering the highest quality services at competitive prices". SmartC offers a range of delivery services, such as: 
· Standard overnight delivery; 
· A premium add-on of guaranteed 10:30 am delivery; 
· A cheaper, three-day service for less time-critical deliveries SmartC has recently launched an app that allows customers to set pickup times and locations on their smartphones, which has received positive reviews in the technology press. 
SmartC has identified the following critical success factors: 
· Deliver sustainable profits to shareholders; 
· Leave customers highly satisfied at every interaction with SmartC; 
· Provide a range of services which meet our clients' evolving needs; 
· Lead the industry with constant innovation. 
Managers at SmartC have a dynamic compensation package which includes share options, goalbased incentives, commissions, and non-monetary public recognition. SmartC also allows for flexible work schedules and is piloting an on-site childcare programme at one of its locations. SmartC receives positive coverage in the press about its work environment and is considered an attractive employer, with motivated employees and a good reputation among job seekers. However, SmartC's profits have dropped in recent years due to increasing competition from global transport companies recently entering the Maxland market. 
Applying the building block model: 
Dimensions 
Results: As a listed company, management will be very interested in measuring financial success - is it delivering sufficient profits and returns for its shareholders? Competitiveness is also critical to measure as new competitors are entering the market in Maxland - is SmartC maintaining or losing market share? 
Determinants: SmartC's managers and staff need to focus on the dimensions of performance that will determine positive financial and competitive results. For example, on-time deliveries will lead to customer loyalty. This falls under quality of service. The company's varied service range should meet the needs of different customer segments; this is an example of service flexibility. Flexibility and quality of service should, in turn, drive positive financial results, for example, higher sales revenue. 
Innovation is also essential to SmartC as it invests in new technology and improves processes with its smartphone app. Resource utilisation is critical to its financial success as efficient use of delivery vehicles, staff and financial resources will reduce costs and improve profitability. In other words, innovation and resource utilisation drive financial success (higher profits) and competitiveness (maintaining market share). 
Setting standards for dimensions 
Financial performance: Growth in sales, net profit margin and return on investment (ROI) are potential targets for regional managers. For example, fixed targets could be set, such as 8% annual growth in sales or a target ROI of 14%. Or, SmartC could use a league table approach by ranking the regions according to these standards and then rewarding managers accordingly. (ROI is detailed in Chapter 17.) 
Competitiveness: With new players in the market, SmartC needs to measure this area of external performance. It can set absolute market share as a standard for measuring competitiveness by dividing SmartC's revenue by the total revenue of the industry in Maxland. A target for regional managers could be to maintain market share as competitive rivalry is increasing in the industry. 
Quality: As a service organisation, SmartC must deliver quality service to retain its customer base. It can set targets for courier agents, such as 98% on-time delivery or call centre representatives to take an order in 3 minutes on average. It will be essential to ensure that these targets are fair and achievable to motivate employees (see below). 
Resource utilisation: SmartC can measure resource utilisation using efficiency standards such as average delivery time or number of deliveries per day. However, equity should be considered here, as urban regions could outperform rural regions as urban customers will be clustered closer together. Flexibility of service and innovation: Flexibility of service can be measured with targets such as 90% of orders scheduled to customers' requests. Innovation can be measured by the % of customers using the smartphone app. 
Note: While the categories used in this section look similar to those used in the section on dimensions above, they are being discussed in the context of targets, which is why they appear under the standards heading. 
Rewards 
SmartC appears to have an effective reward system. The compensation package covers a range of financial and non-financial rewards and benefits, which contribute to the motivation of employees by meeting their different needs. For example, new parents will be motivated by the childcare facilities; other staff may be motivated by the flexible workplace arrangements. It also appears that rewards are performance-based (e.g. "goal-based incentives"), leading to increased motivation. SmartC must ensure that rewards are controllable and clear, for example, by providing targets that are well-defined and then agreed upon in appraisal meetings. 

3.1 Identifying Objectives 
3.1.1 Types of Not-for-profit Organisation 
The non-profit sector includes: 
· Public sector bodies such as schools and hospitals. 
· Not-for-profit (NFP) organisations (e.g. charities) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). NGOs may receive significant funding from the government; NFP organisations typically raise funds from those interested in the organisations' goals. 

Most, but not all, public sector organisations do not have profit as their primary objective and were established to provide "public goods". Their objectives may include usage maximisation and generating satisfaction from those benefiting from the services. Objectives of NFP organisations are more difficult to measure and rank because: 
· They are challenging to quantify. How can a hospital's aim "to improve health in the area" be measured? Information from several sources may be required (e.g. hospital admissions, rates of specific diseases, ultimately life expectancy). Charities may find it challenging to measure the alleviation of suffering or raising the level of public awareness. 
· The achievement of some objectives may be simpler to measure than others. Therefore, there is a risk that the organisation will focus on what can be easily measured rather than what is most important to its long-term future. 
· Achievement of some objectives may be subjective. For example, the objective "to provide a good quality of education" may mean different things to different people. 
· Many non-profit bodies have multiple stakeholders, each with potentially conflicting objectives. 
· There may be no clear primary objective (in contrast with commercial companies with profit maximisation as their primary objective to which all other goals are assessed). 

Example of state-funded university
· University management is accountable to multiple stakeholders. 
· However, stakeholder requirements may conflict: - Students may desire small class sizes, extensive library, etc. - The government wants to minimise costs per student. 
· Designing a performance measurement system with multiple and conflicting objectives is complicated. Management must rank its stakeholders and prioritise goals accordingly. 

3.1.2 Charities 
Charities are one type of not-for-profit organisation, but with several additional distinguishing features: 
· They exist solely to benefit defined groups in society; 
· They may be eligible for favourable tax treatment; therefore, they may have to be registered with a regulator; 
· Their activities are restricted or limited by a regulator;  
· They rely on the financial support of the public and businesses to achieve their objectives; 
· Their financial viability relies heavily on voluntary (unpaid) managers and workers. 
A charity may engage in commercial activities that serve its objectives (e.g. many charities operate chains of retail shops); however, it is the charity's purpose (as specified in its constitution) that is its primary objective (e.g. Oxfam was founded in 1942 for famine relief; Oxfam International is now an NGO with member organisations in 19 countries). 

3.2 Value for Money Objectives 
The value for money (VFM) framework attempts to evaluate the performance of NFP and other non- commercial organisations. VFM focuses on how well the organisation has achieved its objectives given the funding it received. Three performance indicators (the "3Es") measure VFM: 1. Economy - minimising inputs in terms of lowest cost for the quality required (i.e. the lowest cost option may not necessarily be chosen if it does not provide sufficient quality); 2. Efficiency - maximising the output/input ratio; 3. Effectiveness - achievement of objectives. 

Example of Measuring VFM 
The following diagram indicates possible VFM measurements for a typical university. 
University
    |
Area: Economy, Efficiency, Effectiveness
    |
Possible measures: Minimising costs per student, maximising student/staff ratio, quality of degrees awarded
High effectiveness may conflict with economy and efficiency. Multiple and conflicting objectives also may exist due to the various stakeholders involved. There may, for example, be conflicts between stakeholders whose primary concerns are financial/commercial (government/taxpayers) and those concerned with quality of service (e.g. users of National Health Services). Determining the overriding objectives (or the trade-off between different objectives) may be difficult.

Quiz: NFP Objectives 
In recent decades, the public sector has considerably increased management accounting adoption (e.g., in hospitals and schools). Many governments specify objectives for public services, for example: Hospitals - "to improve the standard of patient care". Schools - "to improve the quality of education". Governments have also stressed the efficient use of resources in these areas. Required: Comment on the above objectives and assess how management accounting can contribute towards their achievement. 

Answer:
The objectives quoted in the question are too general to provide a mechanism for measuring whether the school or hospital has attained those objectives. Despite widely acknowledged difficulties measuring the efficiency and effectiveness of not-for-profit (NFP) organisations, management accountants must help managers involved in decisions regarding the organisation's resources. This is especially so in the case of NFP organisations, where a significant proportion of the cost base is fixed. 
· Economy can be defined as: "The terms and conditions under which the authority acquires human and material resources. An economical operation acquires resources of the appropriate quality and provides a service to the appropriate standard at the lowest cost."
· Effectiveness is "The extent to which a programme achieves its established goals or other intended effects." 
· Efficiency is: "The relationship between goods or services produced and resources used to produce them. An efficient operation produces the maximum output for any given resource input or minimum input for any given quantity and quality of services provided." 
From the above definitions, it can be seen that efficiency is the optimum of economy and effectiveness (i.e. the measure of output over input). The above "3 Es" explains what governments mean by "the efficient use of resources in these areas". The introduction of management accounting techniques within hospitals and schools has led managers to focus more on achieving economy, efficiency and effectiveness. The principal problem, typical of schools and hospitals, is measuring such organisations' output (i.e. effectiveness). In acknowledging that non-financial objectives can be more subjective than financial objectives when deciding whether they have been achieved, management accountants need to ensure the definition of organisational objectives in a manner which facilitates the measurement of the extent to which "patient care" and "quality of education" have been achieved. Measurable objectives having been established, the management accountant should develop performance indicators to measure effectiveness (i.e., the extent to which the prescribed goals have been met). The management accountant must ensure that the control systems capture the information used to assess the organisation's effectiveness and that any deficiencies are remedied.

3.3 Non-Financial Performance Indicators (NFPIs)
NFPIs were introduced in Chapter 15. NFPIs are particularly useful in NFP organisations for the following reasons: 
· The overall objectives of NFP organisations are usually non-financial, so it does not make sense to judge their performance primarily using financial measures. 
· Commercial organisations generally have one overriding objective: to maximise shareholders' wealth. However, NFP organisations, particularly in the public sector, have multiple objectives to reflect the needs of different stakeholders (e.g. various people will have different beliefs about what they think a local council should provide). 
· It may be challenging to identify a cost unit in NFP organisations (e.g. in a hospital that carries out many different types of procedures, there is no single appropriate unit of output). This makes financial performance measurement more difficult. 

Key Point 
Performance measurement requires a broad range of performance measures, many of which will be non- financial. 

------
Quiz: Non-financial Performance Indicators 
Suggest ONE non-financial performance indicator for each of the situations below. Explain why you think it would be a useful measure of performance: 1. The quality of education in a school. 2. The effectiveness of a charity that aims to reduce the effects of a particular illness on the population in a developing country. 3. The quality of clinical care in a hospital. 4. The effectiveness of the local police force in dealing with crime. 

Answer:
Note: The question only asked for one indicator for each situation. Additional indicators have been provided as further examples. Other suggestions may also be valid. 

Proposed indicator
1. Quality of education in a school 
Exam results - % of pupils passing final(why a useful measure? Exam results are a measure of how much the pupils exams have learned. Pass rates reflect how well the students have been taught)
% of pupils that achieve entry to University or higher education (why a useful measure? One objective of schools is to enable talented students to achieve their potential and gain entry to a good university.)

2. Effectiveness of charity in reducing the effects of a disease
Fall in the number of cases of a disease reported each period  (why a useful measure? Shows a fall in the disease, which may reflect the charity's work.)
Number of people inoculated against a disease (why a useful measure? Reflects the work performed by the charity, although this may not measure very well how effective the results were.)

3. Quality of clinical care in a hospital 
% of patients that are cured and not readmitted within three months (why a useful measure? Shows % of cases with a positive outcome, reflecting the level of clinical care given.)
Waiting time for operation (time from referral by doctor until procedure performed) (why a useful measure? Long waiting times may be caused by poor clinical care in hospitals, delaying additional operations)

4. Effectiveness of local police force
% of arrested criminals convicted (why a useful measure? Reflects the ability of police to collect sufficient evidence to ensure criminals are convicted.)
------

3.4 Setting Targets 
Targets are often used to improve performance. Actual performance is compared with the targets, and management investigates when targets are missed. This is similar to the concept of comparing financial performance against budgets or the use of standard costing and variance analysis. Setting qualitative targets (those relating to NFPIs) can be difficult in NFP organisations because: 
· Determining the appropriate level of difficulty for the target is difficult. A target that is too difficult may demotivate. A target that is too easy may encourage inefficiency. 
· Meaningful targets need to take into account differences in the external environment. For example, a school's demographics may significantly influence exam results. It may not be appropriate to set the same targets for all schools. 
· Managers judged by the performance measures need to "buy into" the targets set. Managers may be more willing to accept targets if they have been involved in developing them. 
· Identifying measures for qualitative areas can be challenging enough, even before consideration of setting the target. 
· Targets are often based on results rather than effort. In many organisations, the hard work of staff may not always be reflected in the results (e.g. mortality rates in hospitals may reflect many factors, not just the efforts of the medical staff). 

3.5 Assessing Performance Assessing performance in the NFP sector is similar to that in the commercial sector. However, it is essential to consider the organisation's objectives. Performance is only meaningful when judged on what the organisation wishes to achieve. 
· Most NFP organisations do not exist to make profits, so using traditional performance measures such as return on capital employed is meaningless. (Some NFP companies do exist to make profits (e.g. charity shops), but these are required to pass all profits on to charitable causes.) 
· Reducing costs may be good in the sense of increasing efficiency. However, cost reduction may conflict with some non-financial objectives if the quality of the service provided to stakeholders is adversely affected.

Quiz: Evaluation of Performance  
Ayersome Leisure (AL) is a sports centre owned and managed by the council of Bigton. Its mission is "To promote healthy living in Bigton". The council has become increasingly concerned by the growing deficit generated by the centre as the council has to subsidise all such deficits. The financial report of the centre for the last two financial years (most recent and prior) and the budget for the most recent year are as follows: 
|                  | Prior | Most recent | Budget |
| $000             | $000  | $000        |
| Revenue          | 700   | 606         | 792    |
| Less costs:      |       |             |
| Depreciation     | 25    | 25          | 25     |
| Salaries         | 450   | 500         | 550    |
| Maintenance      | 150   | 200         | 200    |
| Other costs      | 124   | 75          | 125    |
| Surplus(deficit) | (49)  | (194)       | (108)  |
The centre offers four sporting activities: Squash, Swimming, Gym and Badminton. The following information is available in respect of these for the most recent financial year: 
|                                    | Squash | Swimming | Gym | Badminton |
| Hours open each day: % utilisation | 12     | 10       | 12  | 6         |
|     Daytime                        | 50     | 70       | 15  | 50        |
|     Evening                        | 80     | 70       | 50  | 50        |
| Revenue ($000)                     | 101    | 203      | 252 | 50        |
| Annual cost saving ($000)          |        |          |     |           |
| If activity is discontinued:       | 21     | 120      | 51  | 60        |
AL offers free access to all facilities to local schools to encourage sports development and to those over 60 years old to promote healthy lifestyles. Free-access users comprise 30% of all users. It is estimated that 60% of these users would continue using the facilities if they had to pay the standard charges. The remaining 40% would not use the facilities if free access were withdrawn. Except for the avoidable costs identified (i.e. the annual cost savings if an activity is discontinued), all costs are general fixed overheads. There has been a decline in evening users of both the gym and the swimming pool because a private health club opened during the year in Bigton. A former visitor to the club commented that he preferred the health club because even though it was much more expensive than AL, it attracted a more exclusive clientele. 
Required: a. Evaluate the financial and non-financial performance of the sports centre for the most recent year. b. Suggest ways the centre's financial performance could be improved. 


Answer:
a. Performance 
The deficit for the most recent financial year is $194,000. This is almost four times that of the prior year and 80% higher than the budgeted deficit. Understandably, the council is concerned about this. The main reason for failure to meet the budget is the decline in revenue, most likely due to opening of a new health club in Bigton, which has attracted some users away from a public sports centre. There is little that AL's management can do about this, as it would not be appropriate for a publicly- funded leisure centre to offer the same luxurious levels of service as a private health club. However, the existence of the competition and the expected decrease in revenue must be planned for in the future and costs reduced. Salaries have increased by 11% compared to the prior year, although this is only half the budgeted increase. This is due to either increased staff numbers or increased salaries or both. Given the revenue decline, management should not have raised the staffing level. Accessibility of the sports centre is good, with squash and gym being available 12 hours per day and swimming 10 hours per day. Badminton is only available for six hours daily, which may reflect a lack of demand. The utilisation of all activities is over 50% except for the gym, which has only 15% utilisation during the day, perhaps due to gym users being at work. Squash is particularly in demand, with 80% utilisation in the evenings. The high utilisation rates mean that the centre provides services valued by the community. The provision of free facilities to the over 60s and schools may appear to be bad from a financial point of view, but AL's objective is to promote healthy living, not to make a profit. Of the 30% of users who enjoy free access, 40% would not use the facilities if they had to pay, so the sports centre satisfies a social need by encouraging people to exercise. Overall, the financial performance is poor, and the sports centre needs to find ways to reduce the deficit in future years. However, the sports centre provides the local community with a good and valued service. 

b. Improving Financial Performance As noted in part (a), revenue fell considerably due to the opening of a private health club. The private club provides an exclusive service to its clients, while a publicly-owned sports centre has an objective of inclusivity. There is little that AL can do to win back the clients who prefer the exclusivity of a private club, so the revenue fall must be accepted. Therefore, improving financial performance requires AL to focus on cost reductions. Badminton is not a particularly popular activity. Revenue from badminton was $50,000. If Badminton were discontinued, costs of $60,000 would be avoided. Therefore, ceasing badminton would save $10,000 a year. Management may consider reducing staff costs. Reducing staff costs to prior year levels would save $50,000. Additional savings might be possible if staff levels are reduced during times of low utilisation (e.g. in the gym during the day when usage is only 15%). While squash and swimming are available for 12 hours per day, it may be possible to reduce this availability during less busy times. Opening one hour later and closing one hour earlier could save costs without causing too much inconvenience to users. Finally, it is noted that 30% of users enjoy free access. If this were to be withdrawn, 60% of these would continue to use the facilities. This means revenue would increase by approximately $109,000 (30% * 606,000 * 60%). However, withdrawing free access may go against AL's stated mission. As a compromise, perhaps free access to over-60s could be "means-tested" (i.e. individuals over 60 on low incomes would continue to enjoy free entry, but those on higher incomes would have to pay).

3.6 Other Approaches 
In many countries, the government has increased the use of performance measurement in the public sector to : 
· Improve efficiency - thereby reducing government spending and tax. 
· Increase transparency - so taxpayers can see what their taxes are being used for. 
· Improve decision-making about allocating scarce resources - so that available finance is used where it will best achieve the government's objectives. 
Although the "3 Es" framework (above) is a cornerstone of many approaches to performance measurement, other commonly used approaches to performance measurement in the public sector include: 
· Zero-based budgeting (see Chapter 9) 
· Benchmarking - this compares the performance of a public sector organisation to that of a "best-in-class" organisation. For example, the performance of a procurement department in a hospital may be compared against that of a commercial organisation. An appropriate metric to measure this performance might be the total cost of placing an order. 
· League tables - these institutional rankings are used in health, policing and education. They help determine whether schools or hospitals are deemed to be "failing", whether police forces are tackling crime effectively and how students rate their university courses. Ranking schools by exam results may lead to poorerperforming schools working harder to compete with better-performing schools. 

4.0 Introduction 
Organisations do not exist in a vacuum, so performance measurement must consider external and internal factors. 

4.1 Stakeholders 
A stakeholder is defined as any person or group affected by an organisation. (Traditionally, performance measurement focused only on the owners' interests.) Ignoring stakeholder objectives may result in adverse implications for an organisation. 
· For example, if staff salaries are too low, good employees may become demotivated and leave the organisation. 
· There also could be strikes. These factors could lead to poor customer service, ultimately affecting the organisation's profits. 
Management needs to consider the most critical stakeholders, consider their objectives, and identify ways to measure how these objectives are being met. Staff surveys, for example, are a common method used to assess staff satisfaction. 

Example of Stakeholder Groups 
The following are the most common stakeholder groups and the aspects of the organisation's performance that are important to them and which the organisation may wish to measure: 
| Group          | Objectives                                             			|
| Employees      | Satisfactory remuneration, Good working conditions    			|
| Customers      | Good-quality products                                 			|
| Suppliers      | Long-term relationships, Pay within agreed terms      			|
| General public | Employment opportunities, Economic effect on the region, Environmental impact|
| Government     | Compliance with law (e.g. environment)                 			|

Quiz: Stakeholder Views of Performance 
The government of Northland privatised the Northland Railway Company in 20X6. The company was split into smaller companies, each operating the trains on a specific route. These companies were then sold to the private sector. One of the private companies formed was the Great Suburban Railway Company, which provides passenger train services on a busy commuter route between the capital city of Bigton and Smallton, a distance of 100 km. Financial and other information relating to the Great Suburban Railway for three financial years are presented below. 
|                                    | 20X7    | 20X8   | 20X9   |
| Revenue ($000)                     | 30,000  | 32,000 | 35,000 |
| Profit ($000)                      | (1,000) | 2,000  | 5,000  |
| Number of passenger journeys (000) | 2,000   | 1,900  | 1,900  |
| Number of employees                | 500     | 450    | 400    |
| % of trains arriving on time       | 70%     | 72%    | 75%    |
Other information 
The Great Suburban Railway is the only company licensed to operate a rail route between Bigton and Smallton. The aims of privatising the trains were to stop the subsidy the government had previously paid to the train company and to increase the punctuality of services. Since privatisation, passengers have complained that the number of carriages on each train has been reduced, leading to a shortage of seats during peak times. 
Required: Discuss the performance of the Great Suburban Railway from the perspective of: a. the shareholder; b. the government; and c. the population of Smallton. 

Answer:
a. From the perspective of shareholders Shareholders will be pleased with the performance since privatisation. Revenues have increased by 16.67% from 20X7 to 20X9, which is good for a business such as railways where demand is likely to be limited. The increase appears due to higher ticket prices, as the number of passenger journeys (volume) fell during the period. While the company recorded a loss in 20X7, the first year after privatisation, it made a good profit in 20X8 and 20X9. Profits have risen by more than revenue in absolute terms. This shows that the company has reduced costs at the same time that revenues have increased. Net profit margin rose from 6.25% in 20X8 to 14.2% in 20X9. The company has performed well from the perspective of shareholders. 

b. The government Generally, The government will be pleased that it no longer has to subsidise the railway and that the company appears to survive in the private sector. Another objective of privatisation was to increase the punctuality of trains. The Great Suburban Railway has improved punctuality, measured as the percentage of trains arriving on time, from 70% to 75% between 20X7 and 20X9, so some progress has been made. However, 25% of trains are still late, and the government (and passengers) will not be pleased. 

c. The population of Smallton The main objective for the people of Smallton likely is to have a reliable train service to the capital which charges reasonable prices. Punctuality has already been discussed, and passengers would likely be happy with the increase in the percentage of trains arriving on time. However, they would hope for further improvements in this area. One area that customers are likely to be unhappy about is the apparent increase in ticket prices. Dividing total revenue by number of passenger journeys, the average ticket per journey has risen from $15 in 20X7 to $18.42 in 20X9, an increase of 22%. This is a significant increase and is not likely to be popular unless accompanied by better service in some way. Customers also complain about the reduced number of carriages, leaving people without seats during peak times. So, it does not appear that passengers are experiencing better service. The number of passengers has fallen by 5% between 20X7 and 20X9. This is likely to be due to the increase in prices. People may find alternative ways to travel to the capital (such as by bus or car) or reduce their journeys. Overall, the people of Smallton are not likely to be happy with the performance of the privatised company.

4.2 Market Conditions and Competitors 
An organisation's market conditions will affect its economic performance and may affect various parts of the organisation differently. For example, performance analysis should consider market differences when comparing two divisions. Competitor performance will directly affect organisational performance. Price competition within a market, for example, will likely lead to price cuts of the organisation's products and have a financial impact. Performance evaluations should consider factors that management cannot control. This principle has been discussed in previous chapters on budgeting and variance analysis, so in summary: 
· Performance evaluation should measure actual results against revised budgets to account for factors not originally considered. 
· Standards can be revised to take into account changes in the environment. For example, the sales volume variance can be split into a market size and a market share variance. 
· Performance can be benchmarked against competitors or organisations adopting best practices in specific business areas in addition to internal targets. 
Performance measurement should be flexible enough to consider external factors. 

4.3 Sustainability 
Since the turn of the century there has been increasing recognition amongst stakeholders of the importance of sustainability and the effects of organisations on society and the environment. To ignore the environment within which organisations operate is not a sustainable approach. At the same time, demand for environmentally friendly products and processes (e.g. electric vehicles) continues to increase. Therefore, Adopting a sustainable business model is simultaneously a challenge and an opportunity for organisations. 

Sustainability - meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. 

In addition to the overall importance of sustainability, there may also be a direct link between environmental behaviour and performance. There are numerous ways in which poor environmental behaviour may damage an organisation: 
· fines (e.g. for pollution or other breaches of regulations); 
· increased liability to environmental taxes (e.g. carbon taxes); 
· reputational damage; 
· loss of sales or consumer boycotts; 
· inability to secure finance; 
· loss of insurance cover. 
However, reducing material, energy and water usage should not only reduce environmental impact but may also reduce operating costs. Similarly, a focus on reducing waste could, in turn, improve process efficiency and reduce the amount (and therefore the cost) of materials used. Equally, although health and safety measures might not add value directly, they can help to protect an organisation from the cost of accidents which might otherwise occur (e.g. increased staff absence and possible compensation claims for work-related injuries). 

Summary:
· The balanced scorecard approach to performance measurement aims to ensure that performance measures support the organisation’s overall strategy. It considers performance from four perspectives – customer, internal processes, learning and growth, and financial.
· Performance measurement in the service sector is more challenging to measure than in the manufacturing sector, due to: Simultaneity; Perishability; Heterogeneity; Intangibility
· The six dimensions of Fitzgerald and Moon’s Building Block model for performance measurement in service businesses are: 1. Financial performance; 2. Competitiveness; 3. Quality of service; 4. Resource utilisation; 5. Flexibility; 6. Innovation
· Performance measurement in non-profit organisations is more difficult due to: difficulty in quantifying the objectives; multiple stakeholder interests.
· Performance measurement in the non-profit sector is often based on the "3Es" (i.e. economy, efficiency and effectiveness).
· Sustainability (i.e. meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs) is not only a challenge but an opportunity for organisations.


Chapter 17: Divisional Performance Evaluation
This chapter covers the following Learning Outcomes. E. Performance Measurement and Control 2. Divisional performance and transfer pricing c) Explain the meaning of, and calculate, Return on Investment (ROI) and Residual Income (RI), and discuss their shortcomings. d) Compare divisional performance and recognise the problems of doing so. 


1.0 Introduction  
Decentralisation - delegation of authority to make decisions. All organisations decentralise to some degree, some more than others. Decentralisation is a necessary response to the increasing size of an organisation and the complexity of the environment in which it operates. Even in a small company, one person cannot make all the decisions; therefore, senior managers delegate decision-making responsibility to subordinates. 
Decentralisation requires the creation of autonomous business units or divisions to align responsibility with decentralised authority. These units can be: 
· Revenue centres - managers are responsible for decisions about revenue generation (usually including selling costs); 
· Cost centres - managers are responsible for decisions about costs; 
· Profit centres - managers are responsible for decisions about costs and revenues; and 
· Investment centres - managers are responsible for cost, revenues, and asset investment decisions. 

1.1 Benefits 
· Senior management can concentrate on strategy - delegating routine decisions frees senior management for long-term corporate planning. 
· Faster decision-making - divisional managers are "on the spot" and can react quickly to changes. 
· Better decision-making - specialist managers will likely understand their part of the business better than senior management. 
· Motivation - divisional managers are given responsibility and status and may increase effort. 
· Training and career progression - divisional managers acquire skills and experience which may prepare them for senior management (e.g. managers may be "rotated" between divisions). 
· Tax advantages - locating divisions in certain areas which enjoy tax incentives or government grants. 

1.2 Problems 
· Lack of goal congruence - the risk that divisional managers will make decisions inconsistent with overall organisational objectives. 
· Increased information requirements - reporting systems must be introduced to monitor divisional performance. 
· Lost economies of scale - costs may rise through duplication of common activities. A central purchasing department may achieve better prices and lower overall overhead than divisional purchasing departments. 
· Loss of central control - top management loses control to divisional managers. Conflict may occur if top management disagrees with the decisions of divisional managers. 

1.3 Conditions for Successful Decentralisation 
SUCCESSFUL DECENTRALISATION: Carefully designed performance evaluation systems to reduce risk of dysfunctional decisions, Business has several separate activities, Central policies to integrate and control (e.g. major capital expenditure, strategic decisions and transfer prices), Divisions should be independent from each other.

2.1 Measurement Characteristics 
A significant risk of decentralisation is that managers may make decisions that are not in the best interests of the overall company ("dysfunctional decisions"). Senior management is therefore responsible for measuring and monitoring divisional performance and divisional managers to ensure, among other things, that junior managers' decisions are in the company's best interests. Therefore, a good performance measurement system should provide for the following: 
· Goal congruence - performance measures should encourage decisions consistent with company objectives. 
· Timeliness - performance reporting must be fast enough to allow any required corrective action. 
· Controllability - evaluation should assess only divisions and divisional managers on performance under their control. 

2.2 Possible Measures 
Focusing on one key performance measure will likely lead to problems associated with inadequate performance measurement, such as myopia and gaming the system (see Chapter 15). Therefore, senior managers should evaluate divisional performance based on a range of measures using a balanced scorecard approach (see Chapter 16). The range of measures could include: 
· variance analysis - taking care to identify controllability (see Chapter 10); 
· ratio analysis (s.2.2.1); 
· non-financial measures (s.2.2.2); 
· return on investment (s.3); and 
· residual income (s.4). The most suitable measures will depend on the type of business unit monitored (see 2.3.3).

· New customers gained 
· Proportion of repeat bookings 
· Orders received 
· Set-up times (also customer waiting times) 
· New products developed

2.3 Controllable and Traceable Profit 
Controllable profit statements are commonly used in profit centres. Here is an example of a pro forma statement: 

|                                            | $  | $ |
| External sales                             |    |X  |
| Internal sales                             |    |X  |
|                                            | X  |   |
| Variable costs Controllable by manager     | X  |   |
| Fixed costs Controllable by manager        | X  |   |
|					     |    |(X)|
| Controllable divisional profit             |    | X |      
| Divisional costs outside manager's control |    |(X)|
| Traceable divisional profit                |    | X |
| Allocated head-office costs                |    |(X)|    
| Divisional net profit                      |    | X |

A problem with such statements is deciding what is controllable or traceable. A manager's performance should be assessed only on costs and revenues under their control. However, the division's success should be evaluated on costs and revenues that are traceable to the division. For example, depreciation on divisional plant and equipment would not be a controllable cost in a profit centre (because the profit manager does not make investment decisions). It would, however, be included as a traceable fixed cost in assessing the division's performance. 

Key Point 

3.0 Introduction In an investment centre, managers have the responsibilities of a profit centre plus responsibility for capital investment. Two measures of divisional performance are commonly used: Return on investment (ROI) and residual income (see s.4).  
Return on investment (ROI) - a return on capital employed which compares income with the operational assets used to generate that income. 

3.1 Calculations 
Key Point 
Profit is before interest and tax because interest is affected by financing decisions, and tax is an appropriation. 

3.1.1 For Manager 
ROI = Controllable profit/Capital employed * 100 

3.1.2 For Division 
ROI = Traceable profit/Capital employed * 100
Decision rule - Divisional performance is favourable if ROI is greater than the cost of capital. 

3.2 Components of Capital 
Capital investment usually has two components: 
· Fixed capital -> Non-current assets
· Working capital -> Net current assets 
ROI is the divisional version of company ROCE (a measure analysts use to advise shareholders to buy or sell the company's shares). It is a measure of divisional performance. It is not an investment appraisal method. In practice, however, divisional managers often use ROI for investment appraisal. 

If divisional managers choose projects with high ROI, the division's ROI should be high. The head office will favourably assess the manager. But, an ROI hurdle should not be the sole measure of a division's purpose, as it may lead to dysfunctional decisions. 

------
Quiz: ROI 
The managers of Division X and Division Y are evaluated using return on investment (ROI) as the primary measure of divisional performance. Each manager is considering a potential investment project for their respective departments. Details of the potential projects, along with information about existing departmental ROI, are provided below: 
|                                             | Division X | Division Y |
| Controllable investment in possible project | $100,000   | $100,000   |
| Controllable profit from possible project   | $16,000    | $11,000    |
| Current division ROI                        | 18%        | 9%         |
| Company cost of capital                     |          13%            |
Required: a. Determine whether the divisional managers would accept the project available to their respective divisions. b. Comment on whether each manager's decision is congruent with the organisation's primary objective, which is to maximise the wealth of its shareholders. 

Answer:
a. Investment decisions 
Division X -> ROI of new project = 16% -> Below current ROI -> Reject project
Division Y -> ROI of new project = 11% -> Above current ROI -> Accept project 

b. Goal congruence The new project available to Division X has an ROI above the cost of capital and should probably be accepted. The new project available to Division Y has an ROI below the cost of capital and should probably be rejected. The divisional managers make decisions in their best interests, not the company's. 
Conclusion: There is a lack of goal congruence. Maximising shareholders' wealth is achieved by investing in projects in which the return on those projects is higher than the cost of capital required to finance them.

3.3 Advantages of ROI 
· As a relative measure, it is easy to compare divisions. 
· Similar to ROCE used externally by analysts. 
· Focuses attention on scarce capital resources. 
· Encourages reduction in non-essential investment by: - selling off unused non-current assets; and - minimising the investment in working capital. 
· Easily understood percentages (especially by non-financial managers). 
· Can be further analysed (i.e. between profit margin and asset turnover). 

3.4 Disadvantages of ROI 
· Risk of dysfunctional decision-making. 
· The definition of capital employed is subjective. For example, should non-current assets be valued using - carrying amount (i.e. net book value); - historical cost; or - replacement cost? Should lease assets and intangible assets be included? 
· If net book value is used, ROI will increase over time because of depreciation. For example, assume an asset cost $100,000, generates $15,000 profit per year, and is depreciated 20% per annum on a straight-line basis. The ROI at the end of year 1 would be 18.75 % [($100,000 - $20,000) / $15,000 = 18.75%]. However, ignoring the time value of money and assuming constant profit generation, at the end of year 3 the ROI would be 37.5% [($100,000 - $60,000) / $15,000 = 37.5%]. This may encourage managers to defer asset replacement. 
· Risk of window-dressing; boosting reported ROI by: - under-investing; and - cutting discretionary costs (especially if ROI is linked to bonus systems). 

4.0 Introduction 
Residual income (RI) - pre-tax profit less imputed interest charge for capital invested. 
Residual income focuses on wealth creation by deducting from profit an imputed interest expense (representing the cost of capital invested). 

4.1 Calculations 
4.1.1 For Manager 
|                           | $ |
| Controllable profit       | X |
| Imputed interest charge   |(X)|
| Residual income           | X |

4.1.2 For Division 
|                           | $ |
| Traceable profit          | X |
| Imputed interest charge   |(X)|
| Residual income           | X |
Key Point Decision rule - accept a project/investment if residual income is positive. 

4.1.3 Imputed Interest 
Imputed interest is a notional interest charge on the division by the head office. 
Imputed interest = Capital employed * Interest rate 
The company's cost of capital is often used as the basis for the interest rate. 

------                                                  
Quiz: ROI and Residual Income 
Division X is a division of XYZ Co. Currently, it earns an annual profit of $2.2 million and has net assets of $10 million. Division X's cost of capital is 10% per annum. The division is considering two proposals. 1. Investing a further $1 million in non-current assets to earn an annual profit of $0.15 million. 2. Disposal of assets at their net book value of $2.3 million. This would lead to a reduction in profits of $0.3 million. Proceeds from the disposal of assets would be credited to the head office, not Division X. 
Required: Calculate the current ROI and residual income for Division X and show how they would change under each proposal. 

Answer:
Current situation ROI 
ROI  $2.2m/$10m =22% 
RI   $2.2m - ($10m * 10%) = $1.2m 

Proposal 1 
ROI  $2.35m/$11m =21.4% 
RI   $2.35m - ($11m * 10%)=$1.25m 

Proposal 2 
ROI  $1.9m/$7.7m =24.7% 
RI   $1.9m-(7.7m * 10%)=$1.13m 
Commentary:
Under the current situation, ROI exceeds the cost of capital, and residual income is positive. The division is performing well.
Proposal 1 is acceptable to the company. It offers a 15% return ($0.15m/$1m), greater than the cost of capital. However, divisional ROI falls, which could lead to the divisional manager rejecting Proposal 1. This would be a dysfunctional decision. Residual income increases if Proposal 1 is adopted, and this performance measure should lead to goal-congruent decisions. 
Proposal 2 is not acceptable to the company. The return on existing assets is 13% ($0.3m/$2.3m), which is greater than the cost of capital and hence should not be disposed of. However, divisional ROI rises, which could lead to the divisional manager accepting Proposal 2. This would be a dysfunctional decision. Residual income decreases if Proposal 2 is adopted, and once again, this performance measure should lead to goal-congruent decisions.

Quiz: Residual Income 
Following the quiz of ROI and Residual for XYZ Co. The method of evaluating the performance of divisional managers has changed from return on investment to residual income. The two divisional managers are considering the investment projects:
|                                             | Division X | Division Y |
| Controllable investment in possible project | $100,000   | $100,000   |
| Controllable profit from possible project   | $16,000    | $11,000    |
| Current division ROI                        | 18%        | 9%         |
| Company cost of capital                     |           13%           |
Required: a. Determine what will be the decision of each of the divisional managers. b. Is the decision-making goal congruent? 

Answer:
a. 
|                     | Division X | Division Y |
| Controllable profit | 16,000     | 11,000     |
| Imputed interest    | (13,000)   | (13,000)   |
| Residual income     | 3,000      | (2,000)    |
The manager of Division X will accept the project. The manager of Division Y will reject the project. 

b. Goal congruent? Yes 

4.2 Advantages 
· Residual income overcomes some of the problems associated with ROI (dysfunctional behaviour and holding on to old assets). 
· It can be linked to net present value, which, theoretically, is the best way to make investment decisions. The present value of an investment's residual income equals the investment's net present value. In the long run, companies that maximise residual income will also maximise net present value and, in turn, shareholder wealth. 
· A risk-adjusted cost of capital can reflect different risk positions of different divisions. 


4.3 Disadvantages 
· Definition of capital employed. (As for ROI)
· Effect of depreciation. (As for ROI)
· Window dressing. (As for ROI)
· It is challenging to compare divisions of different sizes. The manager of the larger division will generally show a higher residual income because of the size of the division rather than superior managerial performance. 
· Less easily understood than a percentage.

Quiz: ROI and Residual Income 
PQR Co is considering opening a new division to manage a new investment project. The forecast cash flows of the new project are as follows: 
| Year  	      | 0      | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| Net cash flow($m)   | (5.0)  | 1.4 | 1.4 | 1.4 | 1.4 | 1.4 |
The company's cost of capital is 10% per annum. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis. 
Required: Calculate the project's projected ROI and residual income over its five-year life.

Summary: 
· Decentralisation allows senior managers to focus on strategy rather than operations. It promotes faster and better decision-making and may better motivate divisional managers. It may, however, result in loss of central control, incongruence of goals and strategies, and increased information requirements.
· Divisional performance measures should be goal-congruent, timely and controllable by the divisional manager.
· The most suitable divisional performance measures depend on whether the business unit is a cost, profit, or investment centre.
· Controllable profit is within the manager's control. Traceable profit is after charging divisional costs outside the manager's control.
· The calculation of return on investment (ROI) is based on: controllable profit (for evaluation of manager); or traceable profit (for evaluation of division).
· Divisional ROI will increase as the manager approves projects with ROI higher than the division’s existing ROI.
· Residual income is controllable profit less an imputed interest charge. Incongruent decisions are minimised when a division accepts projects with positive residual income.
· The major drawback of the residual income approach is measuring returns from divisions of different sizes.



Chapter 18: Transfer Pricing
This chapter covers the following Learning Outcomes. E. Performance Measurement and Control 2. Divisional performance and transfer pricing a) Explain and illustrate the basis for setting a transfer price using variable cost, full cost and the principles behind allowing for intermediate markets. b) Explain how transfer prices can distort the performance assessment of divisions and decisions made. 


1.0 Introduction 
Transfer price - the price at which one division transfers goods or services to another division within a company or from one subsidiary to another within a group. 
An earlier chapter described methods of setting prices for goods and services between independent parties. In an organisation with divisions, the output of one division may form the input for another. A transfer pricing system is required to prepare management accounts for the two divisions, which reflect the work performed by both divisions. The same principles apply equally to two companies in the same group that trade with each other 

1.1 When Needed 
A transfer pricing policy is needed when: 
· An organisation has been decentralised into divisions; and 
· Inter-division trading of goods or services occurs. Transfers between divisions must be recorded in monetary terms as revenue for supplying divisions and costs for receiving divisions. Transfer pricing is more than just a bookkeeping exercise. It can have a significant effect on the behaviour of divisional managers. 

1.2 Objectives of Transfer Pricing 
The objectives of transfer pricing are: 1. Goal Congruence 2. Divisional Autonomy 3. Divisional Performance Evaluation 

1.2.1 Goal Congruence From the performance measurement perspective, it is essential to understand that transfer prices are only necessary to encourage divisions with each other to trade in a way that maximises profits for the company. 
· Transfer prices should encourage divisional managers to make decisions in the best interests of the organisation as a whole. 
· Any organisation with divisions faces a risk of dysfunctional decision-making. Where inter-division trading occurs, this risk is particularly high. 
· Achievement of goal congruence must be the primary objective of a transfer pricing system. 

Key Point 
The Performance Management (PM) exam focuses on transfer pricing from a performance management perspective. Other transfer pricing applications, for example tax mitigation, are beyond the scope of the PM exam. 

Example of Goal Congruence 
ABC Consulting has offices in several major cities in Central Europe. Sometimes consultants in one office work on projects for other offices. The transfer price charged is $1,100 per day of consulting. The managing director of the Budapest office of ABC Consulting discovered that he could hire reliable consultants on a freelance basis for $500 per day. On a recent project, in July, he used the services of a local freelance consultant for five days, paying $2,500 in total. "I've saved the Budapest office $3,000!" he declared triumphantly at the end of the week. During the week in question, the Prague office of ABC Consulting had a free consultant who could have done the work the freelance consultant was hired to do. This consultant earns a fixed salary, so the additional cost to the company of this consultant working on the project in Budapest would have been a flight ticket of $200 and accommodation of $500 in total. 
The decision of the managing director of the Budapest office to hire the freelance consultant cost ABC an additional $1,800 (the fee paid to the freelance consultant of $2,500 less the savings on travel and accommodation of $700). This is an example of goal incongruence. The managing director of the Budapest office made a decision that was good for the Budapest office, but not good for the overall group. The reason for this was that the internal transfer price was too high. 

1.2.2 Divisional Autonomy 
Divisional managers should be free to make their own decisions. A transfer pricing system should help eliminate the head office telling divisions what to do. Also, autonomy should improve the motivation of divisional managers. That said, head office must be mindful when one of the divisions has a much stronger negotiating position than the other. This can result in a transfer price that is unduly beneficial to the performance of the stronger division and detrimental to the performance of divisions in a weaker position. 

1.2.3 Divisional Performance Evaluation 
Transfer prices should be "fair" and allow an objective assessment of divisional performance. The transfer price used should permit each division to make a profit. Profits motivate and allow divisional performance to be measured using positive ROI or RI. 

Key Point 
If there is a conflict between two objectives of a transfer pricing system, goal congruence must take priority. 

2.1 Supplying Division Perspective 
The selling division will accept a minimum transfer price equal to: Marginal (variable cost) + Opportunity cost 
The opportunity cost is usually the lost contribution from external sales, either of: 
· The product subject to the transfer price; or 
· other products which the supplying division makes. 

2.1.1 Scenario 1 - Opportunity Cost Is Zero 
When to use: 
· No external market or External market but spare capacity
· No production constraints 
In this situation, opportunity cost is zero because internal transfers do not reduce contribution from external sales. 

----
Quiz: No Opportunity Cost 
Division Buy requires some components for its electronic games console. Division Sell has some spare capacity and could make the components for a variable cost of $60 each. 
Required: a. Calculate the minimum transfer price acceptable to Division Sell. b. State what will happen if Division Buy can buy externally for $55. c. Conclude whether the actions of Division Buy and Division Sell in part (b) lead to goal congruence. 

Answer:
a. Minimum transfer price= Marginal cost + Opportunity Cost = $60 +$0 =$60. The opportunity cost is $0 because the 500 units needed could be produced within the spare capacity of Division Sell. 

b. External price $55 Division Buy will buy externally. No transfer takes place. 

c. Conclusion Both divisions are acting in the company's overall best interests. By buying externally for $55, Division Buy saves the company $5 per component since the cost to make the components is $60. 
------

2.1.2 Scenario 2 - Opportunity Cost Arises 
Key Point 
An opportunity cost arises when an internal sale sacrifices an external sale. 
When to use: An external market exists, and The supplying division operates at full capacity 

------
Quiz: With Opportunity Cost
Division Red makes Product Y and Product Z. The factory's maximum capacity is 5,000 units per month. This capacity can be used to make either 5,000 units of Product Y, 5,000 units of Product Z or any combination of the two. Y Z Selling price $12 $16 Variable cost $9 $11 Extra cost if sold externally $1 Contribution $2 $4 
Required: a. Determine which product Division Red would make and what would be the monthly contribution of the division. b. Division Blue has asked Division Red to supply 1,000 units of Product Y monthly. Determine the minimum transfer price which would be acceptable to Division Red. c. Division Blue informs Division Red that it can buy product Y from an external supplier for $11 per unit and is not prepared to accept a price above this from Division Red. Explain what would happen if both divisions were given autonomy to make their own decisions. Comment on whether this benefits the company as a whole. 

Answer:
a. Division Red would make Product Z, as this generates the highest contribution per unit. Therefore, the total contribution would be $20,000 per month $5,000 * $4). 

b. The minimum transfer price acceptable to Division Red for Product Y is: 
|                          | $ | 
| Marginal(variable) cost  | 9 |
| Opportunity cost         | 4 | 
| Minimum transfer price   | 13| 
The opportunity cost is the lost contribution per unit from selling Product Z because Division Red would make Product Z (which has a higher contribution per unit than Product Y) for external sale if it did not need to supply Product Y to Division Blue. 

c. Division Red would refuse to sell for less than $13, so Division Blue would buy externally for $11 per unit Both divisions are acting in a way that is good for the organisation as a whole. Although the variable cost to the company of making Product Y is only $9, the opportunity cost of $4 is a real cost. The cost to Division Red of producing Product Y, and therefore the cost to the company, is $13 per unit. By buying externally for $11, Division Blue saves the company $2 per unit. 
------

2.2 Buying Division Perspective 
The maximum transfer price acceptable to the buying division will be the lower of: 
· the external market price (if an external market exists); or 
· the net revenue of the buying division. 
The net revenue of the buying division means the ultimate selling price of the goods/services sold by the buying division, less the cost of those goods incurred by the buying division. 

Example of Maximum Transfer Price 
The bottling division of a large soft drink manufacturer buys special syrup, made according to a secret recipe, from the syrup division. The bottling division adds carbonated water to the syrup to make the drink, then bottles and sells it to distributors. Each bottle is sold for $0.50. The bottling division has calculated that the costs of making and bottling the drink (excluding the cost of buying the syrup) are $0.20 per bottle. Therefore, the net revenue of the bottling division is $0.30 per bottle. If the syrup division were to propose a transfer price above $0.30 per bottle for the syrup, the bottling division would incur a loss. 

2.3 Economic Transfer Price Rule 
In summary: Minimum (per selling division) transfer price ≥ Marginal cost of selling division; 
And Maximum (per buying division) transfer price ≤ The lower of: 
· External market price (if an external market exists); and
· Net marginal revenue of buying division.

Quiz: Alternative Transfer Prices 
Division I is an intermediate division. It supplies a special chemical to division F, the final division. 
Division I has spare capacity. The output of the chemical is limited. Variable cost per kg is $500. No external market for the chemical exists.
Division F processes the chemical into the final product. Each unit of the final product requires 1 kg of the chemical. Demand for the final product exceeds production.
The selling price per unit of the final product is $1,000. The further processing cost per unit in Division F is $200. 
Required: a. Calculate the maximum price Division F will be prepared to pay for one kg of the chemical. b. Calculate the minimum price Division I will accept for 1 kg of the chemical. c. Comment on the performance evaluation issues if the transfer price is: i. $500 ii. $800. d. Suggest an alternative transfer price which would lead to a fairer evaluation of the performance of the two divisions. 

Answer:
a. Maximum transfer price to Division F = Net revenue 
|                                        | $     |
| Selling price                          | 1,000 |
| Further processing costs in Division F | (200) |
| Net revenue                            | 800   |
The net revenue of $800 per kg represents the maximum that Division F would pay Division I for the chemical. If the price exceeds this, Division F will incur a loss. 

b. Minimum price acceptable to Division I 
|                                |  $  | 
| Marginal(variable) cost per kg | 500 |
| Opportunity cost               |  0  | 
| Minimum transfer price         | 500 |

c. Performance evaluation 
i. If the minimum transfer price of $500 is used, Division I will make no profit. 
ii. If the maximum transfer price of $800 is used, Division F makes no profit. 

d. Alternative transfer price 
Any transfer price between $500 and $800 per kg should be acceptable to both parties. Without any further information about the nature of the production process and how much effort the two divisions make, it is difficult to judge what would be a "fair" transfer price. One suggestion might be to set a transfer price that is the mid-point between the minimum and the maximum. This would be a price of $650 per kg. If this were the case, both divisions could share the profits equally.

3.1 Market Price Method 
A market price may be used if buying and selling divisions can buy/sell externally at market price. However, it may need to be adjusted downwards if internal sales incur lower costs than external sales (e.g. due to lower delivery costs). 
Advantages:
· Optimal for goal congruence if the selling division is at full capacity. 
· Encourages efficiency - the supplying division 
Disadvantages 
· Only possible if a perfectly competitive external market exists. 
· Market prices may fluctuate. must compete with external competition. 

3.2 Full Cost Plus 
Under the full cost plus method, the supplying division charges full absorption cost plus a mark-up. Standard costs should be used rather than actual costs to avoid selling divisions transferring inefficiencies to buying divisions. 

Advantages 
· Easy to calculate if a standard costing system 
· Covers all costs of the selling division.
· May approximate to market price. 
Disadvantages 
· The fixed costs of the selling division become exists. the variable costs of the buying division - which may lead to dysfunctional decisions. 
· If the selling division has spare capacity, it may lead to dysfunctional decisions. 
· The markup is arbitrary. 

3.3 Variable Cost Plus 
Variable cost plus is similar to full cost plus. 

3.4 Marginal Cost 
Marginal cost = Variable cost + Any incremental fixed costs, e.g. stepped costs 
Advantages:
· Optimal for goal congruence when: - the selling division has spare capacity; or - no external market exists. 
Disadvantages 
· It may be difficult to calculate (variable cost is often used as an approximation). 

Example of Cost-based Approaches 
Consider a division (A) which transfers its production to another division (B): 
|                                                                                 | A              | B  |
|                                                                                 | $              | $  |
| Selling price                                                                   | ??             | 70 |
| Transfer-in price                                                               | Not applicable | ?? |
| Own variable cost                                                               | 18             | 10 |
| Own fixed cost                                                                  | 12             | 10 |
| Divisional profit                                                               | ??             | ?? |
Using variable cost:
Setting the transfer price at the variable cost of Division A produces excellent economic decisions. If the transfer price is $18, Division B's marginal costs would be $28 ($18 + $10). The company's marginal costs are also $28, so there will be goal congruence between Division B's wish to maximise its profits and the company maximising its profits. If marginal revenue exceeds marginal costs for Division B, it will also do so for the company. 
Although good economic decisions are likely to result, the variable cost approach is unlikely to be used in practice due to significant drawbacks: 
· Division A will make a loss as its fixed costs cannot be covered. This is demotivating. 
· Performance measurement is distorted. Division B is not charged enough to cover all costs of manufacture. This effect can also distort investment decisions made in each division. For example, Division B will enjoy inflated cash inflows. 
· Division A has no incentive to be efficient if the transfer price covers all variable costs. Its inefficiencies will be passed up to Division B. Therefore, if used as a transfer price, it should be a standard variable/marginal cost so that efficiencies and inefficiencies stay within the division responsible for them. 

Using full cost/full cost plus/variable cost plus: 
A transfer price set at full cost (or, better, full standard cost) is slightly more satisfactory for Division A as it can aim to break even. Its main drawback, however, is that it can lead to Division B making dysfunctional decisions that maximise its profits but not the company's. For example, if the selling price fell to $35, Division B would cease manufacturing because its marginal cost would be $40 (($18 + $12) + $10). However, from the company perspective, the marginal cost is only $28 ($18 + $10), and a positive contribution would be made even at a selling price of only $35. The head office could tell Division B to continue making and selling the product, but that would compromise divisional autonomy; Division B's managers will resent an instruction to make negative contributions that affect their reported performance. The full cost plus approach would increase the transfer price by adding a mark-up. This would now motivate Division A, as profits can be made there and may also allow profits to be made by Division B. However, this can lead to dysfunctional decisions as the final selling price falls. The difficulty with full cost and cost-plus approaches is that they treat Division A's fixed costs and profits as marginal costs of goods transferred to Division B. Therefore, Division B has the wrong data for making sound economic decisions for the company.
 
Using variable cost as transfer price basis, $18:
| Division       | A    | B    | Group | Notes                                                           |

| Variable cost  | (18) | (10) | (28)  | Division A and B variable costs are charged at the group level. |

Using full cost as transfer price basis, $30:
| Division       | A    | B    | Group | Notes                                                           |
|                | $    | $    | $     |                                                                 |
| Selling price  | 30   | 70   | 70    | Only external sales are recognised at the group level.          |
| Transfer price | N/A  | 30   | N/A   | Transfer price has no effect at the group level.                |
| Variable cost  | (18) | (10) | (28)  | Division A and B variable costs are charged at the group level. |
| Fixed cost     | (12) | (10) | (22)  | Total fixed costs are charged at the group level.               |
| Profit         | 0    | 20   | 20    |                                                                 |

Whichever transfer price is used, there is no effect on profits reported at the group level.

Key Point 
Any transfer price other than the variable cost of the transferring division has the risk of dysfunctional decision-making unless an upper limit equal to the net (marginal) revenue in the receiving division is also imposed. 
------

3.5 Incongruent Goal Behaviour 
All the practical approaches suffer from the potential problem that the transfer price may lead to behaviour that is not congruent with the overall goals of the company (or group). The selling division may set a price too high for the buying division, leading the buying division to buy externally or forgo production. 

Example of Lack of Goal Congruence 
A selling division has spare capacity. It produces Product B, which has a marginal cost of $10 per unit. Another division within the company used Product B in its production. The selling division can provide all of the supplies required by the buying division within its spare capacity. The buying division can also obtain supplies of Product B externally for $15 per unit. The buying division will buy externally if the transfer price exceeds $15 per unit. This leads to an extra cost to the company overall of $5 per unit of product B because Product B could be produced internally by the selling division for $10 per unit. 

4.1 An Intervention 
Dual pricing is sometimes used in situations where no transfer price would be acceptable to both the buying division and the selling division, so in the absence of intervention by the head office, the two divisions would not trade with each other. The head office may wish both divisions to trade for non-financial reasons; therefore, it may use a dual pricing system to encourage them. Dual pricing works as follows: 
· A higher price is used when calculating the revenue of the selling division for goods supplied to the buying division. 
· A lower price is used when calculating the costs in the buying division for the goods supplied to it by the selling division. 
· The head office absorbs the difference between the two as a head office overhead. 

Summary:
· Transfer prices are needed when goods or services are bought and sold within the same company or between subsidiaries in the same group.
· The primary objective of a transfer pricing system is goal congruence.
· A division with no external market for a product or spare capacity has zero opportunity cost because transfers do not reduce the contribution from external sales. The minimum transfer price is then the marginal cost.
· A division with an external market and no spare capacity would lose external sales if an internal transfer is required. The minimum transfer price is then the marginal cost plus the lost contribution.
· The maximum transfer price acceptable to the buying division is the lower of: the external market price (if there is one); or its net revenue.
· An economic transfer price must lie between the minimum acceptable to the selling division and the maximum acceptable to the buying division.
· Alternative cost-based approaches all suffer from the potential problem of incongruent divisional and overall corporate goals.
